Digital Works is a FREE digital circuit simulator for Microsoft Windows. Its graphical design environment enables the user to construct digital logic circuits and analyze their behavior. Circuits can be composed of simple gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT) and simple flip-flops (D, RS and JK). The user can use tri-state logic to construct systems with buses. Digital Works also provides mechanisms for detecting race conditions and bus contention. One of Digital Works most powerful features is its ability to create macros. This means that you can convert a circuit into a logic element itself. The new logic element can be used as a building block in the construction of more complex circuits. The complex circuit can also be converted into a new logic element, and so on. This enables the user to create a hierarchy of digital objects, with each new level hiding the complexity of its implementation. For example, the user could design a simple 4 bit binary counter and embed two of these into another circuit to create an 8 bit counter. Other examples of macros include: counters; shift registers; data registers.
