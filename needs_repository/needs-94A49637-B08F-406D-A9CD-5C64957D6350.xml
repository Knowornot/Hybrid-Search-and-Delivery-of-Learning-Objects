The under-representation of women in science, engineering, and mathematics in both higher education and 
employment has been well-documented, with negative consequences for both the talent pool available for the future 
workforce and equal opportunity.  While remedies are often focused on the problems leading to girls? attrition 
from science and math in pre-college years, there are also significantly higher rates of attrition from the study of 
science, mathematics, and engineering among female undergraduates and graduate students at the 
college/university level, compared with their male counterparts.3  Mentoring is one tested and proven strategy to 
improve retention of women students in these fields in higher education.  Students benefit from having more 
experienced ?mentors? who can help acquaint them with the opportunities in these fields, offer guidance and 
advice based on experience, and provide support, encouragement, and access to professional networks for further 
career development.4  Mentoring offers personal, one-on-one attention and assistance in ?de-coding? less obvious 
cultural and structural elements of a field. 
A relatively new, highly cost-effective opportunity for mentoring now exists, transcending the common constraints 
of time, synchronous communication, and geography.  Electronic communications have recently increased 
dramatically in the U.S., and are now nearly ubiquitous on college campuses and industrial sites.  Convenient, 
regular, informal discourse between individuals and among groups in disparate locations is now a matter of course. 
To enhance the retention of undergraduate and graduate women students in science, mathematics, and engineering 
by taking advantage of the opportunity to use electronic communications for mentoring, the Women in 
Engineering Programs &amp; Advocates Network5 is developing ?MentorNet.?  MentorNet, the national electronic 
industrial mentoring network for women in engineering and science, is based on the successful results of a pilot 
program developed through the Women in Science Project at Dartmouth College.  ?E-mentoring? ? the use of 
electronic communications for mentoring ? is growing rapidly, but is currently found primarily in K-12 programs, 
targeting both students and teachers.
