"Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering:
Degrees are granted after completion of programs of study that emphasize the application of the natural sciences to the analysis and solution of engineering problems. Advanced courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the life sciences are normally included in a program that incorporates the engineering systems approach for analysis of problems. Students must have a B.S. degree in one of the accredited engineering curricula or satisfy the equivalent of a B.S. degree in engineering as determined by the department concerned.

Master of Engineering and Doctor of Engineering:

Degrees are granted after completion of programs of study in professional engineering emphasizing technical, sociological, environmental, and economic problems involved in the design, construction, and operation of engineering structures, processes, and equipment. Studies include courses in the engineering sciences necessary to the engineering interpretation of the latest scientific developments, as well as courses in design, operation, humanities, and economics to provide bases for the analysis and solution of problems in professional engineering. Students must have a B.S. degree in one of the accredited engineering curricula or satisfy the equivalent of a B.S. degree in engineering as determined by the department concerned."
