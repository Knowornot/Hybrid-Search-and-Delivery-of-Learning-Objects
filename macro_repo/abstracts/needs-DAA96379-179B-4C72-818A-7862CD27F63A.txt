The UCI Advance Program carries out the campus commitment to gender equity and diversity in the professoriate. Originally funded by a NSF institutional Transformation award in 2001, UCI has seen dramatic gains in the presence of women in STEM fields. Based on the success of the Equity Advisor model, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Michael R. Gottfredson institutionalized UCI ADVANCE and extended its mission to include diversity in July 2006. This commitment ensures that equity and diversity will remain essential priorities in advancing excellence in the multiple missions of UC Irvine. In the future as in the past, a culture of inclusion is fundamental to American higher education and its continued global leadership in expanding the frontiers of knowledge.
