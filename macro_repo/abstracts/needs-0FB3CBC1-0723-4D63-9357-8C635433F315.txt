Abstract: "In teaching the Comparative Programming Languages course, one quickly discovers that there are few references in most of the texts to women who have made significant contributions to the field. As we become more aware of the emphasis on recruiting and retaining young women in the computing field, we as educators must take an active part in providing role modelsÂ—both to the young women and to the men who will become the professionals in the field. This paper addresses one mechanism that has been classroom tested."
