The Nature Mapping Program's vision is to create a national network that links natural resource agencies, academia and land planners with local communities primarily through schools. Our goal is to keep common animals common and to maintain our quality of life. Our approach is to train individuals to become aware of their natural resources and to provide the tools to inventory and monitor their resources.
Help us put together the pieces of the puzzle that make up our world.
