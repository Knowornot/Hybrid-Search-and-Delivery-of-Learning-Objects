Undergraduates earn a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.  An overview of the Major Program in Mechanical Engineering is shown here as part of the Common Curriculum requirements for an engineering degree at Cornell. The Major program is inside the dashed box; the overview shows the requirements for a student who has no advanced placement credit. An example is provided to show how this basic program can be modified to meet Pre-Med requirements. 

The Major Program is designed to provide a broad background in the fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering as well as to offer an introduction to the many professional and technical areas with which mechanical engineers are concerned. The program covers both major streams of the major of mechanical engineering."
