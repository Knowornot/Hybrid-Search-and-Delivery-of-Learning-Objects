Nirmal. "In this book, Barry Nirmal presents a whole host of utilities that form a ready-made compendium of software to help and assist the reader and his or her colleagues in their work and to offer them an    in-depth knowledge of the routines' internal workings, making it relatively simple to adapt and tailor them to the needs of individual installations.        *"This book provides the programmer with ready-made solutions to real-life problems and the framework upon which to build more complex and installation-dependent routines. Everyone will find something here, whether they are after an 'off-the-shelf   ' solution or the seed of an idea that they can develop into something much more sophisticated." amp mdash  Steve Piggott, Editor, MVS Update
