This course introduces three foundational areas of computer science: (1) Automata Theory: What are the basic mathematical models of computation? (2) Computability Theory: What problems can be solved by computers? (3) Complexity Theory: What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy? Specific topics include: Finite automata, Pushdown automata, Turing machines and RAMs. Undecidable, exponential, and polynomial-time problems. Polynomial-time equivalence of all reasonable models of computation. Nondeterministic Turing machines. Theory of NP-completeness: Cook's theorem, NP-completeness of basic problems. Selected topics in language theory, complexity and randomness. Course is taught by Prof. Sanjit A. Seshia at the University of California at Berkeley.
