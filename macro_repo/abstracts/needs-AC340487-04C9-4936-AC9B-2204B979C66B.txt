Until last year, Kei Murrell, 13, like most other girls at Mendocino (Calif.) Middle School, considered the school's computer room to be a male preserve, a place where boys talked in programming jargon and played war games. While Kei and her friends were free to use the machines, they stayed away -- largely because, as she says, "there aren't very many girls my age who are into blowing things up on a computer." Kei is still bored by computer shoot-'em- ups, but she and the other girls now feel right at home at the computers. Perched in front of the school's Apple IIs and Macintoshes, they adeptly maneuver mice and tap at keyboards while the boys wait their turn.
