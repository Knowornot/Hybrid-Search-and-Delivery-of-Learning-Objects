Abstract:

"An integrated teaching and learning (ITL) program was initiated in 1992 by a team of faculty and
students who articulated an ambitious vision for undergraduate engineering education reform: ` . . . to
pioneer a multidisciplinary learning environment that integrates engineering theory with practice
and promotes creative, team-oriented problem-solving skills.' The ITL Laboratory was dedicated in
1997 to support this college-wide vision. This paper describes the development process of this new
facility and its major features. The underlying educational value is also discussed. Outreach
activities are described, including a unique on-line system where experimental modules are made
available on the WorldWideWeb."
