"This teaching and learning package (TLP) describes the structure of bone from the macro-scale to the micro-scale and considers its description as a biological composite. The structure of hip replacements is described and common implant materials are discussed in relation to the mechanical properties of bone.

On completion of this tutorial you should be able to:

    * understand the biological structure of bone;
    * consider bone as an engineering material ? its description as a composite and its mechanical properties;
    * understand the requirement for hip replacements and the issues involved in selecting implant materials;
    * select suitable materials for use in hip replacements."
