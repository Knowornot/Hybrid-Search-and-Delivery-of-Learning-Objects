"Penn Bioengineering Graduate Group offers courses of study in several areas of concentration leading to the Ph.D. degree in Bioengineering. Information about faculty, research programs, courses, and resources at Penn for advanced graduate studies in bioengineering can be found on this website. 


The Ph.D. program is designed to train individuals for academic, government, or industrial careers in which research is amental and pervasive activity. The Ph.D. curriculum prepares students for the rapidly changing character of bioengineering research by developing the core intellectual capacities which form the basis for research excellence. 

Combining the resources of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering, School of Medicine, Institute for Medicine and Engineering, School of Veterinary Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, School of Nursing, and the University Hospitals, the department is pioneering in a broad range of research areas in bioengineering."
