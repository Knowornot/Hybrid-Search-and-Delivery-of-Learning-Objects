This is a platform-independent Java allpet that shows the flow of data between components in a simple computer system designed in the textbook "Computer Systems Organization and Architecture" by John D. Carpinelli (Addison Wesley, 2001). After entering an assembly language program and correcting any syntax errors, the user can graphically simulate the fetch, decode, and execute cycles for each instruction in the program. The simulator animates the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and the I/O port; the contents of the CPU's registers, the system's memory, and the I/O port are also illustrated.
