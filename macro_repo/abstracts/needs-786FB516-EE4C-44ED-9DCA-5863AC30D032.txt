"Many of the leaders in Civil and Environmental Engineering -- in academia, research, and practical engineering -- have founded their future on the benefits of an advanced degree program. For many positions, a graduate degree is required or considered a key point of personal development. Our department offers the top-ranked Civil Engineering graduate program in the country, according to U.S. News & World Report. Both MS and PhD degrees are available in a variety of specialized areas. Emphasis is placed on advanced study and participation in creative research.

The MS degree may be completed with or without a thesis. In the environmental engineering and science program, most MS students prepare a thesis, but in the other programs of the department, most MS students do not. The MS degree requires 32 hours of graduate course credit if a thesis is part of the program (with 8 of the 32 hours comprising the thesis), and 36 hours without a thesis. The PhD program requires 32 additional hours of coursework beyond the MS degree, followed by a comprehensive research program and preparation of a dissertation. The department also offers two joint degrees: the master of architecture and master of science in civil engineering (Structures), and a joint master of business administration and construction engineering and management."
