Auburn University is leading African-American Researchers in Computing Sciences (AARCS), a program that aims to broaden the participation of African-Americans at the levels of tenure track faculty and research scientist in the computing sciences.

African-Americans represent 5.2% of all university faculties in the United States of America. In Computer Science, African-Americans represent 1.1% of the faculty, 0.88% of tenure track faculty. The African-American Researchers in Computing Sciences (AARCS) program will address this significant representation gap in the computing sciences. This program is designed to broaden African-American participation at the tenure track faculty and research scientist levels of the education pipeline in the form of a demonstration project. The basis for this demonstration project is founded on empirical research conducted by social scientists that reinforce the programÂ’s goals.

Although African-Americans are the target group for this program, the AARCS program will serve as a model that can be used to target other underrepresented groups. The AARCS program will serve as an empirically evaluated model that can be incorporated into larger Alliance projects.
