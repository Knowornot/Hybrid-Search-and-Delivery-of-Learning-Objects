Tableau3 is a program to enable students to practise doing tableau (i.e. tree) proofs for propositional and predicate logic. Tableau3 is similar in functionality to a much earlier program, Tableau2, but is written in Java (rather than DOS), and so can run on most computer setups, either over the Web or on a local machine. The material is compatible with: W. Hodges, Logic, 2nd edition (Penguin, 2001).
