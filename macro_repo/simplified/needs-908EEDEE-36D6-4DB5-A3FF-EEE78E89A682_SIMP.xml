"There is significant research within the Department of Mechanical Engineering which seeks to better understand how students learn engineering subjects and to develop improved instructional materials that reflect that understanding.  This research takes advantage of long-term, reflective experience in the teaching of engineering subjects and the practice of engineering, the modern approaches and insights of cognitive psychology, and the advances in information technology.  These research efforts are influencing the teaching of engineering nationally and internationally.

Students interested in educational research in the Department of Mechanical Engineering are eligible for support from the Program in Interdisciplinary Educational Research (PIER) at Carnegie Mellon University. This pre-doctoral training grant -- recently funded by the Institute of Education Sciences -- seeks to produce researchers who can expand our understanding of learning and instruction in many domains, including engineering.  The program also seeks to produce professionals who can adapt, communicate, and implement the fruits of research in the educational sciences to further learning and enhance instructor effectiveness in diverse educational settings and business organizations.  Graduates will be comfortable in the worlds of cognitive science and education practice, and have a firm grounding in one or more engineering disciplines.  Graduates will receive a certificate in education sciences, and will be expected to conduct dissertations on education topics."</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>content_language</Name><Value>en-US</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>format</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>requirement</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>other_platform_requirement</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>duration</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_type</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_user_language</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_level</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>context</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_min</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_max</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>difficulty</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_learning_time</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_concept_and_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_skilllevel_prerequisite</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_idea_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_end_user_role</Name><Value/></Attribute></Attributes>
