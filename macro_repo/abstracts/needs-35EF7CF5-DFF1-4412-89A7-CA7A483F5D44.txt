This course studies the compiling process for high-level languages. Topics include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, symbol tables, intermediate languages, optimization, code generation and run-time systems. Students will be expected to use compiler tools to implement the front end, and to write a program to implement the back end, of a compiler for a recursive programming language.
