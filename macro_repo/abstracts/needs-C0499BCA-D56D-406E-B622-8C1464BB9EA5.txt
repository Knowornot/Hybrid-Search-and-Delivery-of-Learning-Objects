The objective of Environmental Engineering study and research at Berkeley is determined by the degree goal. The Master of Science (M.S.) degree provides fundamental education in environmental engineering, science and design. This prepares the graduate for professional practice or for advanced study leading to a doctoral degree. The Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) degree extends beyond the M.S. and includes an engineering project along with additional coursework. The M.Eng prepares students for a professional engineering career. The program leading to a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) develops engineer-scientists, capable of creative and scholarly achievement in professional practice, engineering education and research"
