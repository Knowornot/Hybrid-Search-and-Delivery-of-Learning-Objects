The "Presentation Sandwich" checklist is the mnemonic used in an introductory engineering course to describe the presentation requirements for all technical work. The checklist has two major sections: Section I concerns the Presentation Sandwich itself and Section II concerns Graphical Work. Section I has three sub-sections (A, B, and C), one concerning Problem Context, one concerning the technical work (i.e., the "sandwich filling"), and one concerning the Discussion. Students who do not meet all of the yes/no are required to re-submit their work. Space is left for students demonstrating exemplary work. The checklist is provided to students prior to their assignment.
