The ADVANCE Program began as a five-year, grant-funded project promoting institutional transformation with respect to women faculty in science and engineering fields. With the UniversityÂ’s commitment to continue funding through June 2011, the program is gradually expanding to promote other kinds of diversity among faculty and students in all fields.
