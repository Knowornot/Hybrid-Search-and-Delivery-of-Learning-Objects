"The Environmental Engineering and Science graduate program within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering leads to M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Environmental Engineering or Environmental Science in Civil Engineering (See Degree Requirements for information on which degree you are eligible for). Students may specialize in one of several specialty areas, including air quality engineering and science, aquatic biology/ecology, environmental chemistry, environmental systems analysis, hazardous waste management, water quality microbiology, and water quality process engineering. The program is sufficiently flexible to accommodate a wide variety of interests and backgrounds. Cooperation with other departments and programs of the university encourages the development of a coordinated approach to the solution of complex environmental problems. Each speciality area is built on required core courses and appropriate advanced and elective courses, chosen in consultation with the student√¢??s advisor, to meet graduation requirements. Core courses are listed below, followed by discussions of the specialty areas and their course requirements, listed by specialty area."
