and
Recommendations for Action for U.S. Higher
Education
to Assure High Quality
Precollege and Undergraduate Instruction
in Engineering, Mathematics, and the Sciences
for Everyone.
The long-term success of the national efforts to revitalize engineering,
mathematics, and science education depends critically on outstanding
young faculty today who will increasingly shape and define all our
educational institutions.  It will be through their efforts and leadership that
higher education will improve the quality of instruction in engineering,
mathematics, and the sciences for all students at all educational levels into
the next century.  Their counsel and involvement now is vital to the
national education agenda.

     The National Science Foundation, through the Division of
Undergraduate Science, Engineering and Mathematics Education
(USEME), and in collaboration with the Division of Research Career
Development and representatives from all the Foundation Directorates,
convened a colloquium of fifty-three Presidential Young Investigators
(PYIs) on November 4-6, 1990.  The PYIs, all recipients from the class
years 1984-1989, represented a broad distribution of institutions and
disciplines.  The participants were nominated by their institutions and
selected by NSF for their demonstrable concern for precollege and
undergraduate education and for their potential for future academic
leadership.

     The charge to the colloquium, broadly, was to prepare a report of their
vision and recommendations of the role of U.S. higher education in the
year 2010 and beyond to assure high quality precollege and undergraduate
instruction in engineering, mathematics, and the sciences for everyone.

     This report describes the principal conclusions of the Presidential
Young Investigator Colloquium on U.S. Engineering, Mathematics, and
Science Education for the Year 2010 and Beyond, including their vision
of the future, key courses of action, and recommendations to U.S. higher
education in general, and the National Science Foundation in particular.
NSF expresses its appreciation to Dr. Jack R. Lohmann, from the Georgia
Institute of Technology (on leave of absence from the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor to NSF/USEME from 1989-1991), and Dr. Angelica
M. Stacy, from the University of California, Berkeley, who co-chaired the
colloquium, and to the participants for their thoughtful counsel and
contributions.  The opinions expressed in this report are those of the
participants and do not necessarily represent NSF policy.  The findings of
the participants are currently under review by NSF.</lom:string></lom:description><lom:identifier><lom:catalog>NEEDS</lom:catalog><lom:entry>58D381A1-F226-4977-8DCB-8E05A92336A9</lom:entry></lom:identifier><lom:keyword><lom:string language="en-US">N/A</lom:string></lom:keyword><lom:structure><lom:source>LOMv1.0</lom:source><lom:value>hierarchical</lom:value></lom:structure><lom:title><lom:string language="en-US">America's Academic Future: A Report of the Presidential Young Investigator Colloqium on U.S. STEM Education</lom:string></lom:title><lom:language>en-US</lom:language></lom:general><lom:lifeCycle><lom:contribute><lom:entity>BEGIN:VCARD
