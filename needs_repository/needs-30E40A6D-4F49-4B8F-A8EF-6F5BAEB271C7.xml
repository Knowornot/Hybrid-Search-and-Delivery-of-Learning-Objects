"This report of the National Science Board (Board) lays out our findings and recommendations for the
National Science Foundation (NSF) to support innovations in engineering education programs. The
Board, established by Congress in 1950, provides oversight for, and establishes the policies of, NSF. It
also serves as an independent body of advisors to the President and Congress on national policy issues
related to science and engineering research and education.
In March 2005, the Board undertook an examination of recent recommendations addressing changes
in engineering education and implications for the engineering workforce. This effort built upon the
work of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in its report, The Engineer of 2020: Visions of
Engineering in the New Century, as well as recent Board policy reports that identified issues of concern
for the domestic engineering workforce.
Moving Forward to Improve Engineering Education synthesizes the results of two Board-sponsored
workshops and significant Board deliberations. The first workshop was held at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in October 2005 and included a range of experts representing broad interests
in engineering education. For the second workshop, held at the Georgia Institute of Technology in
November 2006, 23 leading deans of engineering (or equivalent) and the NSF Assistant Director for
Engineering participated in discussions that identified needs for change in engineering education and
model programs to address those needs.
Throughout the process, the Board maintained a dialogue with NAE and coordinated with the
NAE Engineer of 2020 project. Our recommendations in this final report address issues of public
perception of engineering, retention of students in engineering majors, responsiveness of engineering
education to change in the global environment, and needs for additional data to support policy and
planning."</lom:string></lom:description><lom:identifier><lom:catalog>NEEDS</lom:catalog><lom:entry>30E40A6D-4F49-4B8F-A8EF-6F5BAEB271C7</lom:entry></lom:identifier><lom:keyword><lom:string language="en-US">engineering education reform</lom:string></lom:keyword><lom:structure><lom:source>LOMv1.0</lom:source><lom:value>hierarchical</lom:value></lom:structure><lom:title><lom:string language="en-US">Moving Forward to Improve Engineering Education</lom:string></lom:title><lom:language>en-US</lom:language></lom:general><lom:lifeCycle><lom:contribute><lom:entity>BEGIN:VCARD
