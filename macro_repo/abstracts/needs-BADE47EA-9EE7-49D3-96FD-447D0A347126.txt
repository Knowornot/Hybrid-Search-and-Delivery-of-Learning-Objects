provides support services for prospective and current students in the College of Engineering. It advises applicants on opportunities in the College, the admissions process, financial aid, and academic support services of the College and Berkeley campus, and it provides a forum for ideas and programs designed to enhance the educational experience of underrepresented engineering students.

Recent programs have included workshops on graduate admissions, NSF general information and funding opportunities, Postdoctoral workshops, various faculty/student discussions, and a provision of general academic advising and counseling. The GrAD Program is open to all students.
