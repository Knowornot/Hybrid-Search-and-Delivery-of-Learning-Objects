"The department offers two MS degrees and a Ph.D. degree.

The Ph.D. degree is primarily a research degree that represents attainment of a high degree of scholarship in a special field. The course program for the Ph.D. is designed to give every student a general background in fundamental areas of nuclear engineering and advanced knowledge in a selected area of research and in other subjects as dictated by the student's interests and career needs. At the end of one year of study, the student appears for a comprehensive written qualifying examination based on subject matter regarded as the core of nuclear engineering. Students successfully completing this examination are allowed to work towards the Ph.D. degree without an intervening M.S. degree. The program typically contains 50 hours of graduate course credits, excluding research credits, and typically requires four to five years beyond the B.S. degree for completion, including dissertation. Approximately 18 semester credits are in a minor field, and this minor department may elect to test the student separately on courses in that discipline. Following the qualifying examination, the candidate actively pursues dissertation research. Doctoral dissertations result in research publications in major journals. A doctoral degree is generally sought by those who are motivated towards careers in industrial, academia, or national laboratories.   "
