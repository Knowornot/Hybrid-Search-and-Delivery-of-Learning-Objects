Over the past twenty years, the student population in Computer Science departments has become increasingly male, and the number of women among faculty members has remained quite small. Thus, many academic Computer Science Departments are almost exclusively male environments. These notes are meant to be a contribution to dialog on the implications of this fact for premier departments. Some of the quotations are drawn from documents at ETH and the University of Maryland, because I have first-hand experience at both institutions, but the observations and conclusions are more broadly applicable.
