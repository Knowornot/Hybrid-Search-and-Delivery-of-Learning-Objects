The redesigned Ultra-Efficient Engine Project has a strengthened strategic focus
which will promote environmentally friendly, clean burning engines by developing
innovative technologies to enable intelligent turbine engines that significantly
reduce harmful emissions while maintaining high performance and increasing reliability.

The new project will provide cross-cutting technology development & maturation focused on the Subsonic, Supersonic and Rotorcraft.
The UEET Program will utilize a variety of wind tunnels, component test facilities, and high temperature engine materials and structures laboratories at both Glenn and Langley Research Centers.
