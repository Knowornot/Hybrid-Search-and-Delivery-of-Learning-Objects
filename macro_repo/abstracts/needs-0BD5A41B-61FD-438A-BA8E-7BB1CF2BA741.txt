"Environmental and water resources engineering.
This program is designed to educate engineers who will solve environmental and water resources problems by applying fundamental principles from the natural sciences, mathematics, mechanics, economics, and other underlying disciplines. To achieve this objective, the program offers a breadth of possible research and study areas. The faculty is one of the largest and most diverse in the nation, with expertise ranging from environmental fluid mechanics to water resources planning and from pollutant transport to treatment processes. The major areas of emphasis are treatment process engineering, air resources engineering, environmental remediation, water quality, water resources engineering, and ocean engineering. Because the program requires no specific courses, each student's education can be designed to meet his or her goals. The faculty offers a wide variety of courses, and students may choose courses in many other fields. A list of these courses is available from the graduate adviser. Once a student chooses a particular study area, he or she works closely with the faculty member or members conducting research in that area. Each student's program of study includes a balanced combination of coursework, seminars, and research. Well-equipped research laboratories, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and superb computation facilities support the graduate program, as do cooperation and coordination with research faculties and laboratories in physical, chemical, biological, and social sciences and other engineering disciplines."
