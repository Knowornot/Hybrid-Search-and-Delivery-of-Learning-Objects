The primary goal of CSTEP is to create a model with exportable programs to systematically increase the enrollment, retention, and graduation rate of minority students in Computer Science.  CSTEP is funded by the National Science Foundation under the Broadening Participation in Computing Program.  Its main function is to bridge students from community colleges to 4-year universities and graduate school.
