Paper (pdf format) with citation: Sanders, D. and Dorn, B., "Classroom Experience With Jeroo", Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, Vol. 18, No 4., April 2003, pp. 308-316. Abstract: "Jeroo is a tool that has been developed to help students in beginning programming courses learn the semantics of fundamental control structures, learn the basic notions of using objects to solve problems, and learn to write methods that define the behavior of objects. Jeroo is similar to Karel the Robot and its descendants, but has a narrower scope and has a syntax that provides a smoother transition to either Java or C++. Jeroo has been class tested at Northwest Missouri State University, and has proven to be an effective tool for working with students in a beginning programming class."
