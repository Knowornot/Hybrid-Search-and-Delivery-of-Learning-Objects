ENERGY STAR is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping us all save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices.

The website provides the technical information and tools that organizations and consumers need to choose energy-efficient solutions and best management practices.
