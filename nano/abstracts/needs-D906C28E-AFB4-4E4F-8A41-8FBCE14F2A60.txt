SINAM's 7-12 Outreach programs.
Photolithography Experience: Students will learn about photolithography by creating their own circuit board, as well as learn about electrical resistance and Nanomanufacturing. Students will also have a fun time solving mathematical equations and graphing the data they collect. The lesson is designed to take about 2-3 days in a science class period or block. The faculty and staff at UCLA/SINAM is excited about interacting with middle school students and getting more of todayâs youth on a path to pursue a career in the field of engineering.

The SINAM Middle School Outreach Team works with the Camino Nuevo Charter Academy.
