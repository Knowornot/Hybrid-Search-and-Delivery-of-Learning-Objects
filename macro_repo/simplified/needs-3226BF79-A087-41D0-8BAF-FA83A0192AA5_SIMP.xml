The Iowa State program is unique in that its Materials Science and Engineering department has a wide range of outreach activities both locally and around the world. The "Materials Matter" brochure one can download from this site provides more detail. The figure here shows one such outreach program in Africa.

"Our programs and labs provide hands-on learning -
the kind of learning that gives students a competitive
advantage. Many of our graduates have built successful
careers not only as engineers, but also as managers,
entrepreneurs, sales representatives, and consultants.

Materials engineers create new
materials and improve existing
materials. The products we work
on are everywhere; companies
couldn't survive without the
expertise of materials engineers!
Just think of all the different
materials in biomedical devices,
computer chips, clothing, automobile
parts, and, yes, even the kitchen
sink - those are just a few
examples of the products that
our work influences.
Everything is limited by the
materials that are used to produce it.
Materials engineers understand the
relationship between the properties
of a material and its internal
structure - from the macro level
down to the atomic level. In many
cases, we are the people who help
a product become cheaper, easier to
produce, or more durable. The better
the materials, the better the end
result - it's as simple as that."</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>content_language</Name><Value>en-US</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>format</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>requirement</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>other_platform_requirement</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>duration</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_type</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_user_language</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_level</Name><Value>LOMv1.0</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>context</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_min</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_max</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>difficulty</Name><Value>LOMv1.0</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_learning_time</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_concept_and_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_skilllevel_prerequisite</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_idea_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_end_user_role</Name><Value/></Attribute></Attributes>
