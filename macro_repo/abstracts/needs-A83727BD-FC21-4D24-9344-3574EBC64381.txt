"At the highest level, the purpose of a reliability engineering program is to test and report on the reliability of an organization's products. This information is then used to assess the financial impact of the reliability of the products, and to improve the overall product reliability and consequently the financial strength of the organization.

Reliability assessment is based on the results of testing from in-house labs and data pertaining to the performance results of the product in the field. The data produced by these sources is to be utilized to accurately measure and improve the reliability of the products being produced. This is particularly important as market concerns drive a constant push for cost reduction. However, one must be able to keep a perspective on "the big picture," instead of merely looking for the quick fix. It is often the temptation to cut corners and save initial costs by using cheaper parts or cutting testing programs. Unfortunately, cheaper parts are usually less reliable, and inadequate testing programs can allow products with undiscovered flaws to get out into the field. A quick savings in the short term by the use of cheaper components or small test sample sizes will usually result in higher long-term costs in the form of warranty costs, or loss of customer confidence. The proper balance must be struck between reliability, customer satisfaction, time to market, sales and features."
