        <Value>This paper contains a synthesis of research and writing on the subject of recruiting and retaining American Indian and Alaska Native students in tribal colleges and public and private universities, and it presents the results of a study of twenty-four successful American Indian college students who were seniors at a state supported college in Montana. Family support, Indian advocacy group support (for example the work of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society), peer support, and institutional support (including minority student offices) are examined with the purpose of identifying what factors lead to Native student persistence in higher education. Successful students in the study were mostly non-traditional (in the college sense) students who had interrupted their college studies at least once. They identified as obstacles to their college success prejudice, finances, language, and alcohol in descending order. These students were helped in their college career most frequently by caring and understanding faculty. Recommendations are made on what needs to be done to orient new Native students to the higher education setting and what college professors need to do to adapt their teaching styles to the needs of Native students</Value>
