                         Engineering Education.
                                          Chair:  Carolyn Meyers
                                       Georgia Institute of Technology

                                          Rapporteur:  Edward W. Ernst
                                          University of South Carolina.
"Within  the  context of seeking to understand better the  programmatic
implications  of  the broad changes needed for engineering  education,
the  National Science Foundation?s Division of Undergraduate Education
(DUE)  in  cooperation with the Division of Engineering Education  and
Centers  (EEC)  organized  the Workshop on  Restructuring  Engineering
Education.   The  workshop, held June 6-9, 1994 included  65  selected
participants   representing   individual  investigators,   engineering
education  coalitions,  Technology  Reinvestment  Program  coalitions,
engineering  societies, the National Research Council?s (NRC?s)  Board
on   Engineering  Education,  the  American  Society  for  Engineering
Education  (ASEE) Engineering Deans? Council, industry, and  students.
The   charge   was  to  address  the  curricular  content   (including
experiential/contextual learning activities) and  the  broad  academic
framework of an engineering education which is responsive to  the  new
challenges of an increasingly interdependent global society .

The  workshop  was organized around four working groups each  with  14
participants.   Each group focused on one of four  topics:   students,
faculty,  curricula, and experiential learning.  Workshop participants
were   assigned  to  two  working  groups  each  to  promote   maximum
interaction  and  cross-fertilization of  ideas.   It  was  explicitly
recognized   that the issues related to engineering education  do  not
separate  neatly but are interwoven among the topics.  Not  only  must
curricula be integrated but also much of engineering education must be
integrated.   The far ranging scope of the discussions in  each  group
was  reflected in the reports from the scribes and the chairs  of  the
four groups.

This  report  of  the workshop is an integration of the  reports,  the
perspectives,  and the concerns from the four discussion  groups.   An
attempt  to summarize a report on students or faculty or curricula  or
contextual   learning  would  fail  to  convey  the  nature   of   the
discussions.   In  these  discussions,  the  interfaces  between   the
designated  areas received as much attention as the areas  themselves.
Nevertheless,   the  workshop  generated  items  on  which   consensus
developed.   These  are  presented  in  the  Recommendations  and  the
Executive   Summary  with  the  body  of  the  report  providing   the
background."</lom:string></lom:description><lom:identifier><lom:catalog>NEEDS</lom:catalog><lom:entry>86752C18-0269-4F1F-8015-C7E5035297DE</lom:entry></lom:identifier><lom:keyword><lom:string language="en-US">N/A</lom:string></lom:keyword><lom:structure><lom:source>LOMv1.0</lom:source><lom:value>hierarchical</lom:value></lom:structure><lom:title><lom:string language="en-US">Restructuring Engineering Education: A Focus on Change</lom:string></lom:title><lom:language>en-US</lom:language></lom:general><lom:lifeCycle><lom:contribute><lom:entity>BEGIN:VCARD
