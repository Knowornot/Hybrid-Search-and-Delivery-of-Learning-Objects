Description: "This project is designed to increase the work satisfaction, retention, and advancement of women faculty in science and engineering at Boston University through enhancing women's networks, and to analyze the ways in which network-building can contribute to women's satisfaction and success in academic science and engineering. Programs adapted from ADVANCE schools and some developed at BU will be implemented to build strong and functional networks for women faculty. Programs will include pre-tenure mentoring, lunches with leaders, inter-university and industry interactions, re-start-up grants to reinvigorate the networks of female faculty in STEM disciplines, and catalyst grants to support new collaborative research ventures. To evaluate the effectiveness of these programs in fostering strong networks for women, male and female faculty will be surveyed at the beginning of the grant period and at its end about the individuals in their networks who provide them with important resources such as professional advice..."
