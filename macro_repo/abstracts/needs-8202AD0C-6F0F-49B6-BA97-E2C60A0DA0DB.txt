Abstract: Selection of appropriate software plays a vital role in facilitating children?s desire to use computers. The discrepancy between girls? and boys? use of computers is enhanced by the scarcity of gender bias-free software programs. Analysis of the extant literature and rating of children?s software indicates that gender bias is reflected in terms of characters, content and reward systems in the software program. A checklist is developed and pretested in this article. This checklist can be used to generate awareness of the subtle but pervasive gender bias in children?s software programs and can be used by teachers in the selection and use of appropriate software programs in their classrooms.
