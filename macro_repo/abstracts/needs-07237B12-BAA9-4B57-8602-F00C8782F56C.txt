"A student should plan and successfully complete a coherent program of study covering the basic areas of Computer Science and related disciplines. The student's advisor has primary responsibility for the adequacy of the program. The University has two main requirements related to courses. First, each student must 135 course units for graduation. CS Ph.D. students take 9 units (10 units is optimal) a quarter. Credit for graduate work done elsewhere (up to a maximum of 45 course units) may be applied to graduation requirements. Second, students must take from at least different faculty members. There are NO courses specifically required by the Computer Science Department.
