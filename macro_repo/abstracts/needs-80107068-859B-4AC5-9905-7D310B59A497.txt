"The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), originally passed in 1972, enables coastal states, including Great Lakes states, to develop a coastal management program to improve protection of sensitive shoreline resources, to identify coastal areas appropriate for development, to designate areas hazardous to development and to improve public access to the coastline.

 

Michigan was among the first states to have its coastal program approved in 1978. The program is administered by the Administration Section in the Environmental Science and Services Division (ESSD). The program includes local pass through grants and administration of coastal related sections of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451.  Review of federal agency activities for consistency with Michigan's approved program is performed by the Great Lakes Shorelands Section in the Land and Water Management Division (LWMD)."
