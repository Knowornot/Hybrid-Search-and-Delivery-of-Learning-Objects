"The Graduate Program in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering has been rated first in the nation since U.S. News and World Report began ranking graduate programs and was also ranked highly by the last National Research Council review of graduate programs in the United States (1994). A vibrant culture of research and learning exists in the Department as a result of bringing world-class faculty together with outstanding young scientists and engineers, our graduate students, in an environment where they can work together backed by excellent staff and facilities."
