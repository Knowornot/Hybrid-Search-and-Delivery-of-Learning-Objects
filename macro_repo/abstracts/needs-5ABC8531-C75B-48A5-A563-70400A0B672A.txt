Type:  Institutional Transformation.
Year Awarded: 2008. 

Description: Rutgers offers an opportunity to take on the challenges of institutional transformation at an institution that has three geographically dispersed campuses (New Brunswick, Camden, and Newark), each with varying levels of focus on teaching and research. The proposed activities at Rutgers are based on strategies implemented at other ADVANCE institutional transformation grantee sites and will contribute to our understanding of the challenges in the adaptation of strategies to a geographically dispersed multi campus situation.
