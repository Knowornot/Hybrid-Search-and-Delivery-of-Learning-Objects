Curriculum for education and outreach efforts associated with the National Science Foundation-supported Materials Research Science and Engineering Center on Nanostructured Interfaces.
The objective of the curricula is to introduce students to the tools that let us "see" atoms, manipulate them, and create nano-architectural wonders.

The University of Wisconsin - Madison Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) Interdisciplinary Education Group (IEG):
· uses examples of nanotechnology and advanced materials to explore science and engineering concepts at the college level
· brings the "wow" and potential of nanotechnology and advanced materials to the public and K-12.
