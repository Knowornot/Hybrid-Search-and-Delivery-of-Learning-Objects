"In 1995, the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) began an effort to bring more women into its undergraduate computer science (CS) program. At that time, just 7% (7 out of 96) of entering freshman computer science majors at Carnegie Mellon were women. Five years later, the percentage of women in the entering class had increased fivefold. In 1999, women were 38% of the incoming first-year computer science class (50 out of 130)2 ; in the fall of 2000, approximately 40% of the entering class were women. [See Table 1.] Rather than an endpoint, the increasing number of women in the program signifies the beginning of a crucial period of transition for women in computer science at CMU. We are now faced with the challenge of ensuring that women and men in the program thrive. Starting in the academic year 1999-2000, there has been a concerted effort to foster a community committed to this process. We anticipate that the impact of these efforts will be truly transformativeÂ—not only by bringing more women into the computer science program, but by enhancing our position as a leader in the field, strengthened by the interests and concerns of a diverse student body."
