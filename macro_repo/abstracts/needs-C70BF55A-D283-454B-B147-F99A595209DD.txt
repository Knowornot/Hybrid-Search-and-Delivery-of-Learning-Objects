Students generally do not know the complexity that goes into building and programming a robotic arm. In actuality, creating such an arm comes from a design that involves mechanical, electrical, and computer science engineers. This activity allows students to control a robotic arm from both a machine’s and a computer science engineer’s perspective by letting them perform a simple task with a few entertaining instructions and constraints.
