Type:  Institutional Transformation.
Year Awarded: 2004.
"The Academic Careers in Engineering & Science (ACES) program at Case Western Reserve University is part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) ADVANCE program to develop a national science and engineering workforce that includes the full participation of women at all levels of faculty and academic leadership.

As the first private university to be awarded the NSF ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Grant, we have strived over the past three years to create a model of institutional transformation, particularly in the areas of enhanced transparency in faculty recruitment, advancement, development, and retention policies and improved accountability and effectiveness at the school/college and departmental level. CaseÂ’s institutional transformation has been a multifaceted initiative to promote a campus-wide culture characterized by equality, participation, openness, and accountability.

To launch the project the ACES Investigators chose 31 NSF fundable departments to provide a broad set of departmental variety in terms of size, composition, and research methods in order to allow best practices to be thoroughly tested before being recommended to the university at large.

With generous support from the National Science Foundation, NSF-Advance (grant #0245054) the Academic Careers in Engineering and Science (ACES) program at Case Western Reserve University seeks to contribute to the development of a national science and engineering workforce that includes the full participation of women at all levels of faculty and academic leadership."
