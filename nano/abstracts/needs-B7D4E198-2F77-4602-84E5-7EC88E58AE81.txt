"Roughly speaking, the terms "nanoscience" and "nanotechnology" have come to refer to anything whose properties are affected by molecular-sized or nanoscale dimensions. Nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field, like environmental science, and its reach into everday life is far greater than most of us know. From eyeglass coatings to new-and-improved detergents, to genetic engineering and stronger construction materials, nanotechnology is everywhere. "Nano" has varied audiences, who encounter it in many different ways."
