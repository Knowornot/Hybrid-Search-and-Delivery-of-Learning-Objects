MIT OCW is a publication of MIT course materials. It is a free and open educational resource for educators, students, and self-learners around the world.

"The Department of Materials Science and Engineering traces its history back to the founding of MIT in 1865. Over these years, its central function has been the education of students by providing them with the opportunity to conduct independent and creative research at the forefront of materials science and engineering. Today the Department is the largest of its kind in the United States, and it is clearly the leader in many areas of materials education and research. The Department shares in creating the tradition of excellence for which MIT is known.

The Department's strong record of achievement is solidly based on its continuing record of pioneering advances in engineering sciences and technologies, its ability to relate new developments and advances to engineering practice, its success in incorporating these advances into teaching and research programs, and its close relationship with industry.

In advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the Department draws upon faculty and students with many diverse backgrounds. There are few fields of science or engineering that are not concerned in some way with materials. Indeed, the need for materials is as pervasive in our lives as is the need for energy. It has been estimated that the work of one in three engineers is directly related to materials, while over half of all engineers have at least an indirect concern for the properties of materials."
