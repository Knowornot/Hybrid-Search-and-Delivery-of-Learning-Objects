In the program the user can build up an electric circuit, using the mouse, by selecting predefined components from an extensive palette. Based on the graphical drawing of the circuit, ATPDraw generates the ATP file in the appropriate format based on "what you see is what you get". All kinds of standard circuit editing facilities (copy/paste, grouping, rotate, export/import) are supported. Circuit node naming is administrated by ATPDraw and the user only needs to give name to "key" nodes. More than 65 standard components and 25 TACS objects are available, and in addition the user can create new objects based on MODELS or Data Base Modularization.
