Type:  Institutional Transformation. 
Year Awarded: 2006. 

The mission of ADVANCE is to transform the Schools of Science and Engineering at Rice University by increasing the number of women and strengthening the gender-neutrality of the climate in a way that identifies and values the unique skills of each individual and rewards contributions.  Approximately one-third of the faculty in SMET areas will reach normal retirement age within the next 8 years.  This exceptional situation provides Rice the opportunity to significantly increase the numbers of women, including women of color, in the near future.
Goals
Goal 1: Increase Number of Faculty Women in Science and Engineering at Rice
Goal 2: Create a Positive Work Environment that Affirms All Participants
Goal 3: Evaluate Initiatives and Disseminate Information on Successful Programs.
