" The Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering offers engineering education and research opportunities of the highest quality. As one of the oldest departments within this state university, the Department has provided curricula and support services for many decades and earned a reputation among engineering education professionals as one of the finest programs in the nation. The able performance of Illinois graduates in research, industry, education, and government is evidence of this.

The Department offers graduate programs leading to the following degrees:

    * Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering
    * Master of Science in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics
    * Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Mechanical Engineering
    * Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics
    * Joint Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Master of Business Administration


Currently the Department has approximately 315 graduate students, of whom about 54.7% are doctoral candidates. While most of these students enter graduate study directly after completing undergraduate work, some come from industry. The majority of the Master of Science graduates seek industrial positions involving research and development work; most doctoral degree recipients prefer research careers in industry, government, or research and teaching careers at universities. The graduate study programs allow each student to pursue his/her career objectives while participating in important work in areas of basic scientific research and current societal concern. In this setting both students and faculty benefit from expansion of personal horizons while performing significant public service."
