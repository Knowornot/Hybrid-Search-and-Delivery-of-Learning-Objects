Abstract:
"Excel spreadsheet macros and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programs, used as teaching aids in a separation processes course at Tulane University. They were used to solve problems involving trial-and-error and graphical calculations. Distillation, absorption, and interfacial mass transfer problems were solved. The spreadsheets were incorporated into a web-based learning platform. Students increased the use of macros for solving homework problems from 11% to 75% by the end of the semester."
