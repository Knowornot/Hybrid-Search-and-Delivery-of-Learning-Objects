"At the graduate level, we offer a wide range of research opportunities in the main areas of biomaterials, ceramics, electronic materials, metals and polymers. Students applying for the graduate program may be eligible for competitive assistantships or fellowships that enable them to work within their chosen area of concentration.  

Educational programs deal with the scientific and engineering aspects of the structure, properties, synthesis/processing/manufacturing and application of materials. Because graduates in materials science and engineering are challenged to be general practitioners and specialists, the department provides the necessary balance between the fundamental and technical aspects of the field in all specialties.

The department stands among the best materials, metallurgy and ceramics departments in the nation, with current research expenditures of approximately $10 million a year from external contracts and grants. With the firm belief that research is teaching, students are involved in almost every research and development project.

MSE's educational and research program is interdisciplinary, focusing on all materials and their composites. Specialization areas include:

    * Biomaterials
    * Ceramics
    * Computational Materials
    * Composite Materials
    * Electronic Materials
    * Metals
    * Nanomaterials
    * Particle Science
    * Polymers

An excellent working relationship has been established between the department, industry and national labs to foster technology transfer, research and development. Analytical facilities at the Major Analytical Instrumentation Center support UF researchers as well as other universities and industries in Florida and across the nation."
