Abstract:
"The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) is a cooperative
educational venture between the Department of Chemical Engineering
and the School of Business at Queenâs University at
Kingston, Canada. First incorporated into the curriculum of senior
year business and chemical engineering students in the 1994-
1995 school year, TIP provides an invaluable opportunity for these
students to work together in multi-disciplinary teams on real projects
for industry clients. An academically rigorous exercise, TIP
uses non-traditional instructional means such as problem-based
learning, multi-disciplinary teams, and self-directed project work
to create a learning environment paralleling that of the professional
engineer or business person. Although it is still evolving, the
Technology Innovation Program provides a model for other educational
ventures seeking to bridge engineering and business, and
to establish valuable links between the university and industry,
while simultaneously easing the graduating studentâs transition
into the workplace."
