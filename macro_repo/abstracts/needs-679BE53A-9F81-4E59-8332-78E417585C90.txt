"A miniature explosion initiated within a droplet of 6 mm diameter and sitting on a glass plate leads to the upward ejection of a fast liquid jet. The explosion generated with a pulsed laser creates an expanding and then shrinking bubble. During the shrinkage of this bubble a second jet is formed, which surrounds the faster inner one. Both jet tips become instable, the inner jet forming a spherical droplet at its highest point, the outer one creates a crown shaped tip structure. A careful look into the droplet reveals the remains of the bubble arranged on a ring.&#8232;The picture is taken 0.4 milliseconds after the explosion with a consumer digital SLR camera (D200 from Nikon), a macro lens, and a home built strobe using a high power light emitting diode (P7 from Seoul Semiconductor).&#8232;"
