"Stanford's Joint Program in Design dates from 1958, when it was started by Professor Robert McKim. The Program is jointly offered by the Mechanical Engineering Department and the Department of Art and Art History. Over the years, it has graduated over 300 graduate students and many more undergraduates. 

Design concerns itself with conceiving and designing products for the benefit of society. This process requires resolution of constraints arising from technical, aesthetic, human and business concerns. A designer uses his or her creativity, imagination and technical knowledge to satisfy these requirements and create products to satisfy human needs. Product Design concerns itself with the conception and design of product experiences for the benefit of society. It encourages creativity, craftsmanship, and personal expression, while serving larger goals of common good. Students studying Product Design generally follow the Mechanical Engineering curriculum and focus on a process that resolves constraints arising from technical, human, aesthetic and business concerns. The course work provides the skills necessary to carry projects from initial concept to completion of working prototypes. Curricular requirements are outlined below.

Students who also complete the requirements for Mechanical Engineering will receive the ME degree and a transcript that says "Has completed all the requirements of Product Design."
