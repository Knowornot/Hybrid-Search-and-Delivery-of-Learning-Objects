The Global Change Instruction Program (GCIP) produces instructional materials for teaching undergraduate nonscience majors about global change science and issues. The materials are in the form of printed modules, some accompanied by computer software, on selected aspects of the broad topic of global change. The modules are written by experts in each field for students who may not have much background in math or science but whose curiosity is aroused by concern for the environment.
