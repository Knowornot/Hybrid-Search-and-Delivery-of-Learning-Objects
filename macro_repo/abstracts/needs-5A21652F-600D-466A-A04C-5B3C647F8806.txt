"The Doctor of Philosophy is the highest earned degree conferred by Purdue University. The program, as offered by the School of Industrial Engineering, is restricted to those students who have demonstrated superior ability both in their undergraduate and graduate studies. The degree is not awarded on the basis of time spent in residence, or following the completion of any specific number of formal courses, nor research effort. The entire Ph.D. program must be rationally related, should be research oriented, and should culminate in a dissertation of scholarly and literary merit which is indicative of the candidate's ability to conduct original research in industrial engineering."
