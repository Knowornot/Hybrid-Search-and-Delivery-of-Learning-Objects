The 18-credit Engineering Entrepreneurship (E-SHIP) minor combines technology and business to create entrepreneurs and innovators. E-SHIP shows students of any major how to use their unique skills to become innovators in todayÂ’s global business climate.

The E-SHIP minor was founded thanks to a grant from the GE Learning Excellence Fund and the Penn State Leonard Center. The minor is now partially funded through the Gaelen Endowment for Engineering Entrepreneurship and Leadership, the E. V. Bishoff Engineering Entrepreneur in Residence, the Keen Endowment for Engineering Entrepreneurship, and the Eberhardt Endowment for Entrepreneurship in Engineering.
