Two hours of lecture per week. Introduction to technical, social, institutional, and ethical issues in nuclear engineering; nuclear reactions and radiation, radiation protection and control, nuclear energy production and utilization, nuclear fuel cycle, reactor safety, controlled fusion, nuclear waste, medical, and other applications of radiation, nuclear nonproliferation and arms control and engineering ethics."
Course Objectives:     *  Introduce students to the fundamental science and technology that ground nuclear engineering.
    * Illustrate through specific examples the concepts of professional ethics, safety and environmental impact, and social implications of technology.
    * Provide opportunities for students to meet and learn from faculty and engineers from the national laboratories and industry, who will relate personal experiences in the practice of engineering.
    * Introduce students to the major topical areas where nuclear engineers work, including fission and fusion energy systems, waste management, and applications of nuclear processes including bionuclear engineering. Topics covered:
    *  Introduction to nuclear forces, energy, and matter; atoms; light; nuclear structure; isotopes; radioactive decay; nuclear processes and interaction of radiation with matter.
    * Engineering and ethics; professional responsibility; ethical and social implications of technology.
    * Energy production and utilization: comparisons of energy sources, global energy flows; environmental impacts, pollution and global warming; economic evaluation and externalities; proliferation.
    * Biological effects of radiation; sources of radiation, biological pathways and dispersion in the environment; dosimetry units and measurement; radiation protection and control; ALARA; shielding and safety.
    * Reactor theory: nuclear fission and chain reacting systems; criticality.
    * Nuclear power engineering; energy transport and conversion in reactor systems, advanced reactor systems.
    * Controlled fusion: nuclear fusion reactions; fusion reactor concepts, magnetic and inertial confinement; plasma physics; tritium handling; timetable for commercial systems.
    * Medical applications of radiation: Monte Carlo particle transport simulation for radiation therapy, ethics and nuclear medical research.
    * Other applications of radiation: industrial radiography, neutron activation analysis, instrument sterilization, dating.</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>content_language</Name><Value>en-US</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>format</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>requirement</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>other_platform_requirement</Name><Value>N/A</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>duration</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_type</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_user_language</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_level</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>context</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_min</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_max</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>difficulty</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_learning_time</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_concept_and_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_skilllevel_prerequisite</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_idea_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_end_user_role</Name><Value/></Attribute></Attributes>
