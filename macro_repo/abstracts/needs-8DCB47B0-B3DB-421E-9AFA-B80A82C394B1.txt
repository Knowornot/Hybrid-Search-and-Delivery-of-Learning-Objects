The ADVANCE program seeks to actively advance the research and scientific reputation of the University of Arizona by promoting faculty diversity and the equitable treatment of faculty. This mission will benefit scientists, students and citizens of the state of Arizona by promoting discovery and innovation and ensuring all scientists regardless of gender have the opportunity to excel and to be recognized for their achievement. The UA ADVANCE program is managed by the Center for Research, Equity and Opportunity (CREO).

Promoting equity, and gender equity specifically, is not just about being fair. The manner in which science is accomplished and the subsequent rewards it brings are shaped by those who are involved. Unconscious bias in the academy limits the direction science takes and the application of the findings. In recognition of this and with funding awarded by the National Science Foundation's ADVANCE IT program, the University of Arizona (UA) is joining a select cadre of other institutions in providing a model of equity in the academy.
