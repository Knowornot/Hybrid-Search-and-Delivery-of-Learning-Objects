Crystal Formation (evidence): In general ionic compounds don't form as single molecules but as arrays where the total coulombic stabilization energy plays a part in their formation.   Interestingly, the square array of ions is so stable, that it influences the size of the stable clusters at very small numbers of atoms.  This can be shown by mass spectroscopy of the forming ionic compounds where the peaks represent the steps in cubic sizes.  This is an interesting example of 'closed shell' stability on the macro atomic scale analogous to the closed quantum shells that lead to the formation of the ionic bonds.
