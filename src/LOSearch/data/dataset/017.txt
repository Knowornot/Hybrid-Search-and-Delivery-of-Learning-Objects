This web-based software teaches the user concepts about geometric constraint. Geometric constraint solving has applications in many different fields, such as molecular modeling, Computer-Aided Design, tolerance analysis, and geometric theorem proving. In this primer, a solution to the problem of finding a configuration for a set of geometric objects which satisfies a given set of constraints between the geometric elements is detailed. We have provided four different &quot;tours&quot; through the material in order to allow different types of users easy access to the information appropriate to their needs. None of these tours provides direct access to all the material individually, and all of the tours are interlinked. Of course, following any tour as given is neither necessary nor required. The four tours and their corresponding icons are: - Overview - Profile Editor Tutorial - Theoretical Foundations - Implementation Issues This software was originally cataloged at http://www.my-edu2.com/eduframe.htm.
