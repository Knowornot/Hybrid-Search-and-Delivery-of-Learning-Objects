Description: "Developing Diverse Departments (3-D) at NC State" is designed to adopt/adapt a companion set of ADVANCE initiatives in order to address implicit biases and rarely articulated cultural stereotypes held within the university. Project goals are: (1) to increase the number of women and faculty of color in the professoriate, (2) to create a climate that promotes the success of all faculty, and (3) to eliminate factors that elevate women's and ethnic minorities' risk of leaving NCSU faculty positions. The project is organized into two arms. The first arm will increase the number of deans, center directors, and department heads who are actively and effectively creating conditions within their units that are favorable for advancing women and faculty of color. The second arm will increase the number of female and faculty of color who are emerging as academic leaders. Each arm will be linked to a core faculty group, called Advance Scholars, who have committed to becoming knowledgeable and effective change agents within college and university culture. Small and large workshops will bring together the project participants to share insights via informal and formal discussions and presentations. In overview, the project involves ever-widening circles of influence strategically designed to transfer knowledge about bias and stereotypes, through change agents, into communities of current and emerging academic leaders...
