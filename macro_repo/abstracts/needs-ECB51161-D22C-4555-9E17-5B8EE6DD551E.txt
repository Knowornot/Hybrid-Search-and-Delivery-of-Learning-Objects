Long proven as an analytical tool of uncommon accuracy and utility, particle-induced X-ray emission has enjoyed a solid, if narrow, reputation in the area of chemical analysis. Capable of detecting elemental concentrations down to parts per    millio   n, PIXE is now a standard component of the analytical arsenal of the nuclear physics laboratory. Yet in wider avenues of chemical research, PIXE technology is still relatively new and untested.        *An inside look at the nuts and bolts of PIXE from specialists who've refined the technique in biomedicine, atmospheric science, geology, and art and archaeology, this comprehensive introduction to PIXE reveals its conceptual foundation and unique    methodology as well as its, as yet, enormous untapped potential as a primary analytical tool. Particle-Induced X-Ray Emission Spectrometry (PIXE) offers professionals and students a practical, user-based look at the many facets and current uses of PIXE f      or multielemental analysis while providing a stimulus for creative, insightful investigation.        *Beginning with a brief history of PIXE, the book then introduces the reader to the conceptual basics central to understanding and using PIXE. It details the hardware and methodology that make up PIXE, examining its instrumentation, characteristic   s of x-ray spectroscopy, standardization of quantitative analysis, the accuracy of PIXE analysis, and its limits of detection. The technique of focusing proton beams to micron dimensions with the nuclear microprobe is thoroughly detailed, with practical a      dvice on what pitfalls to avoid, and clear illustrations of its present uses in biomedicine, materials science, archaeology, and earth science.        *The following chapters form a comprehensive catalog of the cutting-edge uses of PIXE in a host of fields, shedding light on the technical specifics unique to each area of research as well as the intrinsic versatility of PIXE. A discussion of biol   ogical and medical applications includes a look at sample preparation, micro- and macro-PIXE, the use of PIXE with other methods, and data evaluation. PIXE's role in the compositional analysis of atmospheric aerosols is described, including a look at PIXE      's future impact on global climate research. A look at PIXE's applications in the earth sciences contrasts the analysis of bulk material with grains and crystallites and highlights PIXE's practical uses in key areas of geologic research. PIXE's role in ar      t and archaeology includes a fascinating and detailed exposition of its important role in the analysis of gem stones, pottery, paper-like materials, and pigments and paintings.        *Concluding with a detailed comparative analysis of PIXE with other current analytical methods, the book then provides a fascinating glimpse into the future prospects of PIXE. A must reference for the professional and novice in search of the basic    hardware and methods behind the current state of the science, Par
