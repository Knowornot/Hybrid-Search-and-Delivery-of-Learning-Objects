Abstract: This paper describes the disciplinary program for writing and communications
developed by the Materials Science and Engineering
(MSE) Department at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University, which has been integrated into eight required core
courses spread across our studentsâ three years of study. Preliminary
quantitative assessment of the program indicates positive acceptance
by the students and faculty, significant improvement in the
quality of writing over three semesters, and significant differences in
both the quality and style of writing between senior engineering
students who have not participated in our program and our MSE
students. We have found a positive correlation between four different
indices designed to measure a studentâs self-assessment of communication
skills and a studentâs grade point average (GPA). Surprisingly,
there is no correlation between either studentsâ grades on
papers and projects, or our measure of their improvement in communication
skills, and their GPAâs. This result has important implications
for the design and implementation of writing-withinthe-
discipline programs such as the one described here.
