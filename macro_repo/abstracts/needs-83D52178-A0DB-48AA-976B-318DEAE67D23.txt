Initiated in 1982, this United States Geological Survey (USGS) Toxics Program provides objective scientific information on the behavior of toxic substances in the Nation's hydrologic environments. It conducts intensive field investigations of representative cases of subsurface contamination at local releases, and watershed- and regional-scale investigations of contamination affecting aquatic ecosystems from nonpoint and distributed point sources. The website covers contamination of surface water, groundwater, soil, sediment, and the atmosphere, and provides a photo gallery of contamination, which includes excessive nutrients, organic chemicals, metals, and pathogens. Other topics studied and documented include natural attenuation, models and applications, environmental measurements, abandoned mine lands, site remediation, and agricultural chemicals.
