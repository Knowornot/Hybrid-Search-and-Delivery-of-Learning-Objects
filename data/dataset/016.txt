This web-based software teaches the user concepts about an effective algorithm for computing the numerical range using MATLAB. In this software, we collect a few fairly well known facts about the numerical range and assemble them into an effective algorithm for computing the numerical range of an n x n matrix. Particular attention is paid to the case in which a line segment is embedded in the boundary of the numerical range, a case in which multiplicity is present. The result is a parametrization of the curve that forms the boundary of the numerical range.
