In November 2006 NCWIT (National Center for Women in Information Technology) introduced "in-a-Box" programs: turnkey solutions that address pressing issues facing the IT community, including...

    * The shrinking pipeline and homogeneity of the IT profession and the lack of awareness and misconceptions about IT careers held by girls
    * Climate and practices in undergraduate computing departments that may act as barriers to some students
    * Under-representation of women in positions of influence and innovation in industry and academia, and the need to provide guidance and social support so that women can attain these positions

Each "in-a-Box" program is designed for practical use by IT professionals and supplies all the components necessary for quick and strategic action. Users simply download resources from the NCWIT website and follow a program guide in order to "unpack" a Box and customize it for local use. Program materials include sample letters, templates, slide presentations, and other resources.
