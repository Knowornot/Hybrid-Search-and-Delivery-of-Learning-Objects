The department supports the mission of the university though its undergraduate program by providing students with an appropriate curriculum and educational experience. The course selection and content remain current through continuous assessment by employers, alumni, faculty, and students. Students obtain a broad education that enables them to understand the impact of petroleum engineering solutions in a global, social, and environmental context. To accomplish the mission, the petroleum engineering faculty, with advice from students, alumni, petroleum industry advisory board (PIAB) members, and industry employers, endorse program educational objectives to produce petroleum engineering graduates who in their first years on the job should be able to utilize the knowledge gained from their academic program to:

    * Solve important problems in a modern technological society as valuable, productive engineers.
    * Enter and succeed in a graduate program.
    * Function and communicate effectively, both individually and within multidisciplinary teams.
    * Continue the process of life long learning.
    * Be sensitive to the consequences of their work, both ethically and professionally, for productive professional careers.
