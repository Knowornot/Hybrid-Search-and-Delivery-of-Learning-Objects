Website for course on pedagogical patterns in computer science education. "These patterns are intended to help a professor design and deliver a single course lasting one term or semester. The focus is on Computer Science, though much of the advice may apply to other disciplines as well. Most of the information here is known to most skilled instructors. Some may be new to some individuals, of course, but the intent is not to show anything invented by this author. Instead, as all patterns are supposed to do, the intent is to capture good practice in a compact way so that it may be communicated to others, especially to novice instructors. Many of the patterns are associated with a time scale to guide your thinking about them. However, some may be used in other ways at other scales than the one in which they are categorized.
