"Today in History - April 19, 1957 - Release of FORTRAN programming language. FORTRAN is an acronym for FORmula TRANslation, named so because it was designed to allow easy translation of math formulas into code. Developed by a team of programmers at IBM led by John Backus, it is one of the oldest programming languages and the first high-level language and compiler ever developed."
