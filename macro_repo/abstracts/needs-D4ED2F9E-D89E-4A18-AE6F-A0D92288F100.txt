Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between student results in a first year programming course and predisposition factors of gender, prior computing experience, learning style and academic performance to date. While the study does not suggest that any dominant attributes are related to success in programming, there are some interesting outcomes which will have implications for teaching and learning.
