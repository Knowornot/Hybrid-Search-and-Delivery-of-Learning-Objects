Description: Washington State University will address institutional transformation at a land grant, research-intensive university in a small, rural, agricultural community where it is the main employer. The project will take advantage of the nearby location of the University of Idaho, particularly for dual career placements, which would make this project the first to directly impact institutions in multiple states.
