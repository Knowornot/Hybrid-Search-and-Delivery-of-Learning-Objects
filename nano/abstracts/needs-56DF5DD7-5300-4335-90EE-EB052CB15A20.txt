"Underlying the Nanoworlds Learning Resource is Nanopedia, The Web Encyclopedia of Nanotechnology. On the one hand, Nanoworlds provides learning modules for formal education; on the other, Nanopedia is a searchable knowledge base.

You are now located at the entry point, or root, of Nanopedia. From here, it branches out in four directions: the science of the Nanoscale, Nanoengineering, the impact of nanotechnology on Society and Applications, and the Future of Nanotechnology as depicted in art, fiction and earnest speculation."
There is an overview and then links to four main topics areas: nanoscience, nanoengineering, impacts and applications and futurism, fiction and art."
