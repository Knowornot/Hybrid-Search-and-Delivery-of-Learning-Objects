Java is known for several important finds of early hominid specimens. [7] In particular, the 1891 discovery of cranial fossil remains commonly known as "Java man" (now designated as Trinil 2, after the Trinil site on the Bengawan Solo River) is notable as the first early hominid specimen found outside Europe. In the following course of human history, several kingdoms existed on Java. The first kingdoms ruled there were Indianized kingdoms like Tarumanagara and Sunda, influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism. Sailendra (8–9th century), Mataram (752–1045), Kediri (1045–1221), Singhasari (1222–1292) and Majapahit (1293–1500) were among them, leaving evidence of their existence throughout Java. Among many other temples in Java, Borobudur (a Buddhist temple) and Prambanan (a Hindu temple) are the most famous relics of the old Javanese kingdoms, both of which are listed in the UNESCO world heritage site.

Islam spread into the Indonesian archipelago in the thirteenth century, including Java, where Wali Songo (the "nine ambassadors") were the most prominent Muslim evangelists at that time. The spread of Islam (1200–1600) first took place at coastal cities before they grew into Muslim states, such as Sultanate of Demak (1475–1518) and Mataram Sultanate (1500s–1700s).

In 1602, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) arrived in the archipelago and subsequently occupied and maintained control of trade and power for more than 300 years. VOC established Batavia (present-day Jakarta) on the northern coast of Java as its trading center and administrative headquarters. Coastal cities, such as Semarang and Surabaya, developed into major trading harbors and the Dutch also developed Bandung in the inner mountainous region of west Java while they planned to move the capital from Batavia
