Year Awarded: 2006. 

"The project will also create an ongoing invitation-only Conversations About Collaboration Seminar to serve several purposes: 1) provide a high-status venue for the members of the template collaboratory to present their research and to talk about the advantages of interdisciplinary collaboration; 2) to provide opportunities for women faculty (especially junior faculty) to network with a select cadre of junior and senior peers, both female and male; 3) to offer incentives (in the form of small travel grants) for new collaborative work to women faculty and their chosen research partners; 4) to facilitate privileged information flow to women faculty and their chosen research partners about new research agendas in industry and government; and 5) to match junior women faculty with institutionally savvy mentors in senior faculty and administrative ranks, under the proactive leadership of NJIT's provost, who has a strong record of supporting women and supporting interdisciplinarity in research. The Collaboration Seminar will be co-hosted by NJIT's new Industrial Diversity Advisory Board, composed of senior executives in business and industry--a link that will further increase the social capital of the participants. In addition to acting as a venue for the dissemination of research data, the Seminar will also provide best practices training in the process of collaboration itself, including cross-gender and cross-cultural communication skills and greater sensitivity to gender schema.

To assess the effectiveness of project's strategy, the PI will map changes in network complexity in research-oriented social space over time and correlate those changes with traditional measures of research productivity, career satisfaction, and retention. The PI will also study whether new pervasive information technologies (including NJIT's NSF-funded SmartCampus cyberinfrastructure) are effective in increasing information flow among collaborators who are housed in different departments."
