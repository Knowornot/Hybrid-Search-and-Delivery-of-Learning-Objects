Paper from IJEE Special Issue, Vol. 21 (2), 2005: The Entrepreneurial Engineer: Educating Tomorrow's Innovator.

Abstract:
"Entrepreneurial education has gained increased attention within the engineering education community
in recent years resulting in the development of several new programs or options within
existing programs. In response to this new national focus on entrepreneurial education and as part
of the engineering curricular development at Michigan Technological University (MTU) associated
with the calendar conversion from quarters to semesters, the university developed the
Enterprise Program (www.enterprise.mtu.edu), a new and innovative experience that provides all
students on campus, but especially engineering majors, an opportunity to start up and operate their
own business. Within engineering programs the philosophy behind the Enterprise Program is to
provide a flexible curricular structure that leads to a traditional engineering degree while at the
same time enabling students to participate in the operation of a real enterprise over multiple years.
Now in its fourth year of operation, the program has grown to nineteen different enterprises
comprised of approximately 450 students from a variety of engineering, science, business, and
communication disciplines. This paper presents an overview of the curricular structure of the
program, a look at one of our established enterprises, the Wireless Communication Enterprise, and
the results of assessment performed to date. Program feedback and successes and challenges
associated with this innovative entrepreneurial curriculum will also be discussed."
