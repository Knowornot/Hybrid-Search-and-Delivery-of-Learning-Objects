The sequence courses starts with an â??Introduction to Nanotechnologyâ?? is followed by the courses â??Introduction to Nanoscale Functional Materialsâ?? and â??Structural and Biomaterialsâ??. Each of these courses incorporates the fundamentals of materials science with illustrations focusing on applications in nano and bio technology. The parallel courses â??Nano-scale Materials laboratoryâ?? and the â??Energetic of Macro/Nanoscale Materialsâ?? round out the Sophomore year. 

The Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania is recognized as a leader and innovator in Materials Research and Education. Our faculty and students have received many of the top awards in their respective research fields, our educational program has produced leaders both in industry and academia, and our University is ranked in the top five in the United States. In 1960 we became one of the first universities to establish a center for Materials Research. This center, which is called the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM), is now one of the largest in the country and is currently funded as a National Science Foundation (NSF) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center. Our faculty also lead the NSF-supported Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC), â??Molecular Function at the Nano/Bio Interfaceâ?&#157;, and the State of Pennsylvaniaâ??s Nano Technology Institute that focuses on the research, development and commercialization of nanotechnologyâ??s real world applications."</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>content_language</Name><Value>en-US</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>format</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>requirement</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>other_platform_requirement</Name><Value>N/A</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>duration</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_type</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_user_language</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>interactivity_level</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>context</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_min</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_age_range_max</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>difficulty</Name><Value/></Attribute><Attribute><Name>typical_learning_time</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_concept_and_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_skilllevel_prerequisite</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>taxon_path_idea_discipline</Name><Value>DEFAULT</Value></Attribute><Attribute><Name>intended_end_user_role</Name><Value/></Attribute></Attributes>
