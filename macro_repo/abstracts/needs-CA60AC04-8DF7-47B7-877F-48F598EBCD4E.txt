The mission of the Resource Action Programs is to promote resource knowledge and conservation habits for students and households in the areas of energy, water, renewable resources, and pollution. The two programs, LivingWise and Learning to be WaterWise, teach participants through a combination of classroom activities and at-home learning projects that individual actions really add up to incredible savings. Developed for grades 4-8 by the nonprofit National Energy Foundation, the programs build student skills in basic core subjects required by State and National Learning Standards. The programs are implemented in schools at no cost through sponsor funding or grants issued from the Resource Action Program.
