An introductory course (syllabus) in nanoscale science and engineering of new materials. The control and manipulation of atomic structure can create new solids with unprecedented properties. Computer hard drives, compact disc players, and liquid crystal displays (lcds) are explored to understand the role of new materials in enabling technologies. Group problem-solving sessions are used to develop understanding.
