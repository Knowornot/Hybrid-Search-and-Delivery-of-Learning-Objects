" The Environmental Science and Engineering (ESE) Program offers a coherent program of education and research spanning the large scales of global climate studies to the local scales of engineering solutions to environmental problems such as toxic waste remediation. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of environmental science and engineering, the ESE Program unites scientists from Caltech's Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences in studies of the functioning and coupling of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere."
