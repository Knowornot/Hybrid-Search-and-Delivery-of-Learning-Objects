Video lecture by Susan Hagness on "Computational Techniques in Bioelectromagnetics: Medical Applications of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method ". "The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is one of the most powerful computational techniques for directly solving Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics. Advances in the computational power of high-performance workstations and supercomputers as well as the declining costs of computing have made the FDTD method a practical analytical and design tool for a variety of electromagnetic wave systems. In this talk, I will highlight recent algorithm developments and modeling techniques that have greatly extended the range of applicability of this method to the field of bioelectromagnetics. I will also give an overview of technology developments arising from the application of computational electrodynamics in medicine and biology. Promising research directions include the exploration of diagnostic electromagnetic wave exposure systems, such as a microwave sensor for detecting early-stage breast cancer."
