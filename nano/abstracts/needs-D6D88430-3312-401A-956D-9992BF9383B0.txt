"Nanoengineering is making practical products in the nanoscale range by patterning matter using nanofabrication to methods with precise control of atoms and molecules extending this precise control seen in molecular structures to design larger and more complex materials. Such products as nanotubes or bucky tubes are capable of supplying electrons when exposed to light allowing for applications in solar energy cell production. At the same time in nanomedicine, carbon nanotubes are engineered as ideal scaffolds for the growth of bone tissue promoting faster fracture healing."
