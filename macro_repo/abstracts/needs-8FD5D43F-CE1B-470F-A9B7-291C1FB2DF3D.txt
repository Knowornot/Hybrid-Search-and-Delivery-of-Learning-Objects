Description: NDSU FORWARD is committed to establishing a university culture in which all are nurtured and supported to develop to their fullest potential, and the criteria for success and achievement incorporate the unique skills and contributions of both men and women. NDSU FORWARD will be instrumental in creating a culture of support balanced with concern for personal and family values and responsibilities, enhancing job performance and satisfaction. We envision an environment where women are leaders and decision makers at all levels of the University. By these efforts NDSU will transform as an institution and will demonstrate its commitment to gender equity through a record of accomplishment in recruitment, development, and retention of women.
