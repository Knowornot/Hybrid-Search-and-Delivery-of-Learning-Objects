Abstract: There is a small but growing body of evidence that
entrepreneurship programs add value to students, the degree
programs in which they are housed, and the institutions that host
them. The Engineering Entrepreneurs Program at North
Carolina State University, a program in which undergraduate
students participate in design teams formed around technology
start-up company themes, was started with funding from the
NSF-sponsored SUCCEED (Southeastern Universities and
Colleges Coalition for Engineering Education) Coalition
primarily to improve the confidence and retention of
engineering students.
Multiple assessment approaches including surveys, focus
groups, interviews, longitudinal assessment of retention and
academic performance, and anecdotal evidence triangulate on
the success of this program at meeting its primary objectives and
others. Particularly, the longitudinal study revealed that
program participants had higher engineering retention rates (70
percent vs. 51 percent) and GPAs (3.08 vs. 2.83) than a matched
set of non-participants. The program and its rigorous
assessment serve as models for the engineering entrepreneurship
community.
