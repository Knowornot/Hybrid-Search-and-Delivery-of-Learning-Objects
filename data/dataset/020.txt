The purpose of these animations and multimedia tutorials are "to assist learning some key Computer Science topics on the World Wide Web. The work is presented in eight learning modules: Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, Machine Architecture, Number Systems, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, and Software Engineering. Each module consists of a set of lessons with animations and interactive components including review questions. The work consists of 44 animations, 2,008 files, and 255 folders, totaling 15.5MB. The learning modules enable educators to provide a learning environment beyond the bounds of the classroom either to supplement their in-class teaching or as part of a distance learning course. The animations and interactive components are expected to improve the effectiveness of learning the covered topics."
