Abstract: This paper describes the use of CyclePadâan articulate virtual
laboratory for creating and analyzing thermodynamics cyclesâat
three different types of educational institutions: a research university,
an engineering technology program in a large state university,
and a military academy. Case studies of each site were
created based on classroom observations, student surveys, and
interviews with faculty. In comparing these three institutions, we
found that the context of the school and the ways in which professors
chose to implement CyclePad led to different student experiences.
Depending on the types of problems that students
worked on, they found the software more or less helpful in increasing
their understanding of thermodynamics. Students in
the class that had the most constraints on its curriculum, where
little change was possible, were less able to take full advantage of
the softwareâs capabilities.
