==============================================

HSDLO (Hybrid Search and Delivery of Learning Objects) is a Java-based engine that facilitates the personalized search and delivery of learning material (objects) from the web. The system combines a number of processes to achieve this: keyword-based search, concept-based search, and personalization. The keyword- and concept-based search methods are responsible for establishing the relevance of each learning material retrieved from the web.
