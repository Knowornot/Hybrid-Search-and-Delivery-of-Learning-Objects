Vision is a visual-programming environment in which a user can interactively build networks describing novel combinations of computational methods, and yielding new visualizations of their data without actually writing code. Nodes encapsulating specific computational methods are organized in libraries and displayed in Vision. The user can drag-and-drop them onto a canvas and connect their input and output ports to define an execution flow. Subnetworks can be encapsulated into macro nodes, allowing nesting of networks. Tooltips and balloon help provide runtime information about a node's function, inputs and outputs. Data flowing through nodes can be interactively monitored and introspected. A data type manager holds a pre-defined set of data type objects and new types can be added to this table interactively through a GUI.
