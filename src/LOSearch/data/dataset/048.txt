Coursewebsite for graduate course in complexity theory at CMU. The site provides a syllabus, problem sets and sollutions. "This is a graduate course on the theory of computational complexity. Complexity theory is the study of how much of a resource (such as time, space, parallelism, or randomness) is required to perform some of the computations that interest us the most. In a standard algorithms course, one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.
