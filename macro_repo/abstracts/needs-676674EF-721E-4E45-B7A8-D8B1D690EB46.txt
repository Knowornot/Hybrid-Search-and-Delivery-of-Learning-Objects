"The profession of electrical engineering demands a strong foundation in physical science and mathematics, a broad knowledge of engineering techniques, and an understanding of the relation between technology and society. Curricula at Stanford are planned to offer the breadth of education and depth of training necessary for leadership in the profession. To engage in this profession with competence, four years of undergraduate study and at least one year of postgraduate study are recommended. For those who plan to work in highly technical development or fundamental research, additional graduate study is desirable.

A four quarter program of graduate study in electrical engineering may lead to the degree of Master of Science. Some students complete the program in only three quarters, but typically a fourth quarter is added to allow a more reasonable course load. A two to three year program, offering a wider selection of engineering course work, more opportunity for study in the related fields of physics, mathematics, and engineering, and in particular, more independent work and individual guidance, may lead to the degree of Engineer.

The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is offered under the general regulations of the University. The doctoral program, requiring a minimum of 135 completed units of graduate study, should be considered by those with the ability and desire to make a life work of research or teaching."
