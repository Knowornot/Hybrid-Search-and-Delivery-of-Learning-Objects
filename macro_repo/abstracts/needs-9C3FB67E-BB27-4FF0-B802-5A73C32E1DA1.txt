The goal of WISEST is to increase the number, participation, and leadership status of women in academic science and engineering at UIC, and to:

    * Create an institutional environment that promotes the retention and advancement of women faculty in science and engineering.
    * Collaborate with faculty, staff, and university leaders to affect institutional transformation.

This goal will be accomplished through five specific project strategies:

   1. Warm the climate and decrease the isolation of women STEM faculty.
   2. Pilot initiatives to attract and recruit minority women faculty.
   3. Transform STEM departments to foster diversity and women's leadership.
   4. Promote STEM women's scholarship and teaching.
   5. Improve the ability to track and report on gender equity in STEM.

And advocate and collaborate across the UIC campus and nationally to increase the presence and influence of STEM women in the academy and workforce.
