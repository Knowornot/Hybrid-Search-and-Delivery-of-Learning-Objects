" The Nuclear Engineering graduate program provides students the opportunity to develop a broad, yet thorough understanding of the science and technology related to nuclear sciences and nuclear power. It is an interdisciplinary program that applies the knowledge of thermal-hydraulics, neutronics, advanced controls, materials science, and radiation science and engineering to the design and operation of nuclear power plants, and to the safe uses and management of radiation. Graduates have career opportunities in the nuclear power industry, national security, government agencies, national laboratories, universities, radiation application industries, and hospitals. The mission of the nuclear engineering program is to provide instruction, perform research, and provide services related to society√¢??s use of nuclear power and radiation."
