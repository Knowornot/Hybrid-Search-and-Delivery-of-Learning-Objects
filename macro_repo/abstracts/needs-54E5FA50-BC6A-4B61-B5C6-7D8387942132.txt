"The doctoral degree is the highest degree that can be awarded to a student. Attainment of this degree demonstrates high achievement in the field of Bioengineering, including excellence in scientific research and continued intellectual leadership as an independent researcher. A student seeking the Ph.D. in our department undertakes a rigorous set of core courses, thrust courses, courses outside the department to broaden background, and a focused research project. Three major milestones punctuate that work: the Qualifying Examination, the General Examination, and the Final Examination (dissertation defense).

The goal of our graduate program is to prepare bioengineers for careers in industry and the academy. Our objectives are:

   1. To provide bioengineers with an in-depth understanding of mathematics, engineering principles, physics, chemistry, physiology, and modern biology.
   2. To train bioengineers to apply basic sciences to medical and biological problems, using engineering principles.
   3. To train bioengineers to recognize and provide engineering solutions to clinical problems.
   4. To train students to do bioengineering research.
   5. To train students to teach bioengineering at the graduate and undergraduate levels.
   6. To train students to apply bioengineering research to commercially viable problems."
