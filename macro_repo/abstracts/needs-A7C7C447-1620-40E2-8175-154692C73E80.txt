"This teaching and learning package (TLP) provides an introduction to piezoelectric materials.On completion of this tutorial you should:

    * Understand the atomic basis for piezoelectricity.
    * Understand how this basis scales up to a full effect on the macro scale.
    * Understand how piezoelectrics tie in with ferroelectrics and how their properties arise from the same basis.
    * Understand how the properties of piezoelectrics are put to use both industrially and commercially."
