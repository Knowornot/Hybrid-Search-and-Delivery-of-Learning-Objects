"Construction management is a combination of:

    * engineering technology
    * construction techniques
    * management 

The program is designed to prepare students for the art of achieving maximum profit by efficient use of people, machines, materials, and money to complete a construction project on time and to the satisfaction of the owner. A melding of engineering, construction, management, and business gives the student a background and understanding of management√¢??s point of view in the construction industry. The Construction Management program is accredited by the American Council for Construction Education.

Junior and senior Construction Management majors must maintain a minimum 2.50 institutional grade point average to be eligible for enrollment in 300 and 400 level courses offered by the College of Business Administration. A Minor in Business Administration is a graduation requirement."
