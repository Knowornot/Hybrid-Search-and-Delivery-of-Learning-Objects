Floys are used to demonstrate social, territorial artificial life implemented in Java. eFloys are evolving Floys using genetic algorithms. iFloys look like ordinary Floys, but they are basically different: While ordinary Floys are all of the same kind, sharing the same properties, iFloys can have an individual character. Each iFloy possesses its own traits, defined by a single chromosome. Applets are used to demonstrate. Useful links to other resources in artifical life. Experiments include: Alife, Bioinformatics, Xml, Photos, Photo Manipulation, Dolls Assemblage and More.
