The objective of the undergraduate program is to provide basic and applied knowledge in petroleum engineering, with equal emphasis on drilling and completion, production and reservoir areas using the fundamental building blocks of mathematics, physical and engineering sciences.
Specific Programs Objectives:

   1. To produce a petroleum engineer who has a basic and applied knowledge in drilling and completions, production and reservoir engineering;
   2. To develop an understanding of the application of basic engineering science principles to petroleum engineering;
   3. To develop the ability to analyze, synthesize, and design open-ended petroleum engineering systems, understand the associated uncertainties, and evaluate the economic impact;
   4. To develop the ability to use necessary computer software for solving engineering problems;
   5. To develop effective oral and written communication skills; and
   6. To promote teamwork among students.
