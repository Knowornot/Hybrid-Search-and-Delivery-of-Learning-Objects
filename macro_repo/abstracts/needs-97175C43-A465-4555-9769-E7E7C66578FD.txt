It has been ranked 6th in the US News and World Report for the last several years. During Fall 2005, we had a total of 217 students with 84 in the PhD program. Fifty-seven percent of our graduate students are US citizens. During the 2005-2006 academic year, the School graduated 74 M.S. and 15 Ph.D. students.
