"The PhD represents the last formal stage of academic training for an engineer, and can lead to a variety of careers in industry, government, and academia. Our PhD program aims to teach students to conduct research, to develop the maturity of judgment necessary for critical, creative, and independent thinking, and to contribute to scientific and engineering knowledge in a particular area of scholarship. The conduct of this research, as well as the versatility expected of a productive member of the profession, requires a breadth of knowledge of chemical engineering fundamentals and their applications.

The department has set minimum requirements that it expects every student to satisfy. These requirements are designed to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate differences among students with respect to interests, aptitude, and expected career paths. Students are encouraged to take the initiative in seeking opportunities for formal and informal intellectual exploration beyond the guidelines imposed by the degree requirements. Please be aware that as our faculty continually work to refine and improve the PhD program, our guidelines may change. "
