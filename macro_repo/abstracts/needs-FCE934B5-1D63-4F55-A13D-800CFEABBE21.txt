"The Program in Engineering Science and Mechanics (ESM) offers three graduate degrees Ã¢?? an undesignated Master of Science (MS), a Master of Science in Engineering Science and Mechanics (MSESM), and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Students in ESM may also participate in the CEE program and receive an MS, MSCE, or PhD with emphasis in engineering science and mechanics.

Engineering science and mechanics provides educational and research opportunities in the fields of continuum mechanics, stress analysis, dynamics, vibrations, controls, computational mechanics, fluid mechanics, biomechanics, acoustics, wave propagation, optimization, stochastic processes, materials science, and experimental techniques. The ESM graduate student will find a great number of related classes in other schools of the Institute. Programs at the MS and PhD levels are specifically designed for individual students and matched with faculty expertise and professional goals of students. The program encourages flexibility and interdisciplinary interests in the planning of individual programs of study."
