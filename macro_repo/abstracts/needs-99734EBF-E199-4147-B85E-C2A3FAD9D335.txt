The ADVANCE Program at New Mexico State University began in 2002, with a successful Institutional Transformation grant from the National Science Foundation. This grant continues to work to extend womenÂ’s participation in academic careers in the sciences and engineering. Between 2002 and 2006, the strategies used doubled the number of female scientists hired into faculty positions at NMSU from 17% to 34%.

In 2006, New Mexico State University established ADVANCE as a permanent program at the Teaching Academy. This ongoing program has a broader focus, serving all faculty members, especially underrepresented faculty.
