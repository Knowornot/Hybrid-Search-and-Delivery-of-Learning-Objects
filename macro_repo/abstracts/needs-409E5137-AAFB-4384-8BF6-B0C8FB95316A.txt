Abstract:

"There is no debate that computers are ubiquitous tools for the engineer in
training as well as the practicing engineer. In addition to being able to use a
computer as a tool, we propose that engineers of all disciplines, and not just
those studying electrical and/or computer engineering, should be able to
program computers. A student body familiar with computer programming
enables a more thorough treatment of advanced courses as well as yielding
graduates with valuable skills that they will need in industry.
Despite the fact that many engineering programs have altogether dropped
teaching computer programming to their non- ECE majors, other programs have
continued to require an introductory programming course at the freshman level
for all engineering majors.

A variety of platforms are used in these courses,
from the traditional general- purpose programming languages like C, C++, or
Java to programmable engineering tools such as MATLAB, Mathcad, and even
Excel. We present our case for keeping programming as a key introductory
course in undergraduate engineering. Our program utilizes a common course
thread for the first two years of study. Having a student population already
programming- literate enables us to conduct significant course projects that go
beyond simulation to involve actual design and build.
Our experiences indicate that teaching C programming is a good choice for
engineering students.
