The "goal of this program was to create a digital library of microstructures for functional ceramics with emphasis on materials used for structural, electronic, and thermal applications. This library will be used in ceramic education and research to (1) illustrate the role of microstructure in dictating the macroscopic properties, (2) highlight changes in the microstructure resulting from degradation processes (corrosion, creep, oxidation, dielectric breakdown, etc.) associated with the intended function, and (3) conduct virtual measurements of selected properties.

This DLCM will be used to enhance the educational experience at all universities teaching ceramic science and engineering.

One benefit of the DLCM is that it will provide faculty with a wealth of digital images that can be used to illustrate microstructures of a wide variety of functional ceramics in both the as-fabricated condition and after extended use. By including key macroscopic properties with selected micrographs, one can demonstrate the relationships between these properties and the associated microstructural features such as grain size and shape, phase distribution, and the properties of the constituent phases. The availability of images illustrating changes in microstructure after extended use will also allow faculty to describe typical degradation processes such as corrosion, creep, oxidation, dielectric breakdown, slow crack growth, delamination, and phase instability. Finally, the ability to conduct virtual measurements related microstructure characterization, oxidation, and mechanical properties, will allow students to generate data sets that can be used to demonstrate and validate fundamental models describing these effects."
