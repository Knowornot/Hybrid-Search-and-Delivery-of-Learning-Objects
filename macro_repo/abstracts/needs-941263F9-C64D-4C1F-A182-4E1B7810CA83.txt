"Our program emphasizes multidisciplinary teams in classroom courses and on research projects.  Professors and graduate students from our Department work closely with those from the Departments of Geology and Geophysics almost daily. Some of our projects also include other departments across campus. Opportunities are unlimited. My own areas of emphasis and research cover multidisciplinary reservoir development and management projects, reservoir engineering, simulation, and economics."
