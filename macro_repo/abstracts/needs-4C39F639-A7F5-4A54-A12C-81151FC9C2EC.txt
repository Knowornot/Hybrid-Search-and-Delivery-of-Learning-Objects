"Graduate study in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering prepares students for leadership roles in practice, development, and research pertinent to environmental and urban problems. At the graduate level, students are expected to increase the depth of their academic training in their particular area of expertise, and to develop the capacity to collaborate with individuals from other disciplines. Because of its diversity of interests and association with other JHU departments, the department can offer a broad range of graduate programs based on the natural, social, and engineering sciences."
