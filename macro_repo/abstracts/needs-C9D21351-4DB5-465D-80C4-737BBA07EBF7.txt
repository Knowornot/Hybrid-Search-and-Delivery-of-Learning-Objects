In the "Programming Languages" course, junior/senior Computer Science students compare and
contrast concepts and techniques used in various programming languages. The concept of scope, which is essential to reading and writing large programs, is one of them. The Scope in Programming Languages courseware was designed to help students understand the different types of scope and learn concepts associated with them by repeatedly solving problems. The courseware consists of five modules: Static Scope, Static Referencing Environment, Dynamic Scope, Dynamic Referencing Environment and Procedure Callability. Each module includes introductory material about the topic (definition, example, pragmatics, algorithms) and an applet that generates problems, solves them, checks user's answers and gives detailed feedback. Each applet can potentially generate an infinite number of problems, and helps the learner track progress by keeping statistics.
