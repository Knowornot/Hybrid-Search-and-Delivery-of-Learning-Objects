Course website at UC Berkeley. The course is on high performance computing by showing that numerical experiments are becoming a third pillar of the scientific method, complementing theory (because many phenomena are too complicated to understand theoretically) and conventional experiments (because many phenomena or devices are too difficult, expensive, slow or dangerous to measure or prototype in the laboratory). Second, thecourse motivates the need for parallelism, by showing that despite the exponentially increasing power of serial processors over time, using many of them in parallel is essential to solve very large problems. Some trends in high performance computing are discussed with data from the TOP500 list. Third, the course describes the challenges in writing and understanding parallel programming, a more difficult activity than conventional serial programming. The primary goal is to give students an understanding of when and how to use parallel machines, how the machines are built, the languages and libraries used to program them, and the algorithms and applications that are most common. Powerpoint is available by clicking on the lecture title in most cases. For pdf use either the 1x (one slide per page) or 6x (six per page) links.
