The tr660 program models the mineralogy and physical properties for various chemical compositions in the Earth's mantle where a transition occurs in these properties at about 660 km depth. The program is based on the algorithm described in a paper by Donald J. Weidner and Yanbin Wang. It is written in Java from a FORTRAN code originally developed for this paper. This program is designed to be used for research purposed to test the effects of varying chemical composition, temperature, and physical properties on the inferred physical properties of the Earth through these phase transformations. The graphing output is versatile allowing the user to view any of the calculated variables as a function of depth. The output can be imported to a file in the users platform for further analysis.
