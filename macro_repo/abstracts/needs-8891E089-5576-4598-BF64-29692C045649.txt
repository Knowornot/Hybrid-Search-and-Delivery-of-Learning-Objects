"Project Lead The Way, Inc. is developing a new sequence of high school courses in the Biomedical Sciences. This program will parallel and mirror the highly successful PLTW(TM) Engineering Curriculum currently used by over 1600 schools in 46 states. 

The PLTW(TM) Biomedical Sciences program will consist of a sequence of four courses:  Principles of the Biomedical Sciences, Human Body Systems, Medical Intervention, and Scientific Research.  The goal of the program is to provide rigorous and relevant curriculum that is project and problem-based in order to engage and prepare high school students for the post-secondary education and training necessary for success in the wide variety of careers associated with the Biomedical Sciences including, physician, nurse, veterinarian, scientific and pharmaceutical researcher, therapist, and technician.

The writing team for the first course consists of high school teachers, university professors, and industry representatives. The first course will field test in selected schools during the 2007-2008 school year, and will be available nationwide in the fall of 2008.  Each subsequent year the next course in the sequence will be published."
