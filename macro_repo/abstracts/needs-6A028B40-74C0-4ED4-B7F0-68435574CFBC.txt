The Global Volcanism Program (GVP) seeks better understanding of all volcanoes through documenting their eruptions. This site documents worldwide activity and provides weekly reports of events, a list of volcanic regions, and links to other volcano websites. There is also a gazetteer that includes volcano names and regions, and in some cases details such as volcano type, location, coordinates, volcanic history, elevation, descriptions, and seismic readings. A listserv is available for announcements or inquiries about any aspect of volcanology.
