The Department offers a four year program leading to a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. In first year, you will take basic maths and sciences, engineering mechanics and computation, computer drafting, and an innovative hands-on lab which introduces you to basic concepts of mechanical systems. In second year you will learn about energy and power cycles, materials, and mechanics, and participate in a group design project. Third year introduces you to aerodynamics, heat transfer, and the design of machines. Your studies culminate in a major computer-based design project, together with manufacturing and a series of elective courses. Throughout your studies you will be using well-equipped experimental and computer labs, and you will do design work using state-of-the-art solids modelling software.

    Our programme is accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board, and prepares you for licensing as a professional engineer by Professional Engineers Ontario.
