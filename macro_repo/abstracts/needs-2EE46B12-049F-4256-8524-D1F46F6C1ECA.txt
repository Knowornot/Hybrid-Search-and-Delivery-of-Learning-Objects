Abstract:
"This paper reports our experiences in teaching
introductory programming for engineers in an interactive
classroom.. We describe how the course has evolved fiom
the traditional course, the structure of the classroom, the
choice of software, and the elements involving interactive,
active, and collaborative learning. We discuss our strategy
for assessment. We describe the assessment results including
a retrospective assessment of the previous course. We
suggest how the course relates to the non-traditional
student. We conclude with some suggestions for ji4ture
modifications."
