"Physics is crucial to understanding the world around us, the world inside us, and the world beyond us. It is the most basic and fundamental science. Physics challenges our imaginations and leads to great discoveries that change our lives. The computer that you are using and the laser that reads your CDs were developed as a result of basic physics research. Are you curious about how the world works?"
