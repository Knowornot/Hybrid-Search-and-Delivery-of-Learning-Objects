"If you spent your childhood taking things apart, you might find manufacturing engineering to be a great career option. Manufacturing activities involve problem-solving, creativity, curiosity, and a certain degree of technical and business knowledge. In a typical manufacturing engineering program, you'll study math, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, stress analysis and design, physics, electrical engineering, safety, public policy, and applied chemistry. Computer aided design (CAD) software will also play a role, as computer technology continues to simplify the entire manufacturing process."
