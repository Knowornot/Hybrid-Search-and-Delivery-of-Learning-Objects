"The ADVANCE Program at Brown seeks to increase the retention and advancement of women faculty in science and engineering by facilitating the path to career success for all faculty.

Funded with a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundation, the ADVANCE Program supports new initiatives for formal faculty development programs to ensure that all facultywomen and menhave access to the types of resources that cultivate opportunities for success at the highest levels in academia and academic leadership. The overarching goals of the new programs are to provide faculty with institutional and departmental resources that enhance access to peer networks at Brown and in the wider academic community, foster leadership opportunities, and increase opportunities for collaboration and for obtaining grant funding."
