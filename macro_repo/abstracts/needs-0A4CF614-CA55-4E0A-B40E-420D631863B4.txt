The presentation given by Professor at California State University San Bernardino reports on faculty technology training in which graduate students served as mentors to university professors in a teacher education program. The project was originally designed to serve faculty members in a PT3 project and later expanded to serve faculty members in the entire College of Education. The presenter will share the design of the project, rationale of the design, and expansion of the project. The presentation attendees will learn how to provide effective technology training to university professors by involving students. An example and a checklist will be provided to attendees who are interested in implementing a similar project. Preliminary data will be shared with the audience as well.
