It includes such areas as surveying, geodesy, photogrammetry, mapping, cartography, spatial computing, GIS, LIS, and AM/FM (Automated/Assets Mapping and Facilities Management), but has a more holistic approach to the entire discipline than any one. It also includes areas such as CAD, computer vision, and many other application areas in which spatial data are required. Geomatics engineering is also oriented toward dealing with spatial information throughout its entire life and use, in all the environments of its use and influence, rather being restricted to any one particular area.

The Bachelor of Science in Geomatics Engineering program is designed to provide a background in basic mathematical and physical sciences, a thorough grounding in the measurement sciences, an appreciation of photogrammetry, geodesy, GIS, mapping, cadastral systems and many of the application areas of this field. Course work also includes studies in a wide range of professional skills, legal and ethical matters, the relationship of the profession to other professions, and an understanding of the role of the geomatics engineer in city and regional planning. Basic engineering studies in statics, dynamics, chemistry, and physics are also included in the curriculum. 

Program educational objectives

    * Geomatics engineering graduates will demonstrate proficiency in applying analytical tools (mathematical and computational), basic and engineering sciences, and spatial sciences and design, thereby promoting practical professional excellence in engineering practice.
    * Geomatics engineering graduates will engage in creative problem-solving activities through planning, design and implementation of a range of geomatics engineering projects within realistic constraints.
    * Geomatics engineering graduates will be active professionally and engage in life-long learning. A large percentage will become licensed professional surveyors or engineers.
    * Geomatics engineering graduates will demonstrate effective communication skills (oral, written, graphical and electronic) individually and in multi-disciplinary teams.
    * Geomatics engineering graduates will demonstrate knowledge of contemporary issues, including the need for a diverse workforce, and an understanding of the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental and societal context. Professional and ethical responsibility will guide their engineering career."</lom:string></lom:description><lom:identifier><lom:catalog>NEEDS</lom:catalog><lom:entry>3D9D3061-5DB3-4980-985C-73297D553B6B</lom:entry></lom:identifier><lom:keyword><lom:string language="en-US">N/A</lom:string></lom:keyword><lom:structure><lom:source>LOMv1.0</lom:source><lom:value>hierarchical</lom:value></lom:structure><lom:title><lom:string language="en-US">BS Degree in Geomatics Engineering  at Ohio State</lom:string></lom:title><lom:language>en-US</lom:language></lom:general><lom:lifeCycle><lom:contribute><lom:entity>BEGIN:VCARD
