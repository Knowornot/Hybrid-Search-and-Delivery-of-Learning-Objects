"Graduate fields cross traditional college and department boundaries and afford a graduate student maximum flexibility in designing a program represented by faculty from virtually any discipline on campus. Both fields offer programs for M.S./Ph.D, Ph.D., and M.Eng degrees. Forty-three faculty members comprise the Graduate Field of Mechanical Engineering and thirty-five faculty members, the field of Aerospace Engineering. The fields of Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering share a Graduate Field Office and Graduate Field Administrator. Each field has a Director of Graduate Studies, a faculty member from the field who serves in the position for a three-year term.

M.S./Ph.D & Ph.D. Programs
Research degrees, the M.S./Ph.D. and Ph.D, are offered by the Graduate Fields of Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering; no terminal Master's degree is offered. Prospective students with a bachelor's degree may apply directly to the Ph.D. program or to the M.S./Ph.D. program. Students who have already completed, or are in the process of completing, a Master's degree, apply for the Ph.D. program. Within each field, a student may indicate interest in one of the following six areas of research:

    * Biomedical Mechanics
    * Dynamics, Systems, and Controls
    * Engineering Materials
    * Fluid Dynamics
    * Nano-and-Micro Scale Systems
    * Thermal Systems"
