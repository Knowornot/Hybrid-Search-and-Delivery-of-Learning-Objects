"The Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University is a university-funded organization devoted to nurturing science and technology at the nanometer scale. It is equally devoted to the education of future scientists and engineers.  Our mission is to provide a venue where researchers from all disciplines of science and engineering can come together to share ideas and discuss their views and prospects of nanoscience, nanoengineering, and nanotechnology.   The institute provides administrative support to the faculty and to joint projects and programs, supports joint research initiatives, performs fund-raising, sponsors seminars and conferences, encourages entrepreneurism, encourages multi-disciplinary collaborations, connects to external organizations, and supports educational initiatives from the kindergarten to the professional level."
