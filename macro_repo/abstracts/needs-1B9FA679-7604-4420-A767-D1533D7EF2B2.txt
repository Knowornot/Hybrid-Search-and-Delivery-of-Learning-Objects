CodeLab is the web-based interactive programming exercise system for introductory programming classes in Python, Java, C++, C and other languages. Designed to reduce attrition and raise the overall level of the class, It is a heavily used, seasoned system that has been used in over 100 institutions. Since 2002, CodeLab has analyzed over nine million exercise submissions from more than 27,000 students.

A CodeLab has over 300 short exercises, each focused on a particular programming idea or language construct. The student types in code and the system immediately judges its correctness, offering hints when the submission is incorrect. Through this process, the student gains mastery over the semantics, syntax and common usage of the language elements.
