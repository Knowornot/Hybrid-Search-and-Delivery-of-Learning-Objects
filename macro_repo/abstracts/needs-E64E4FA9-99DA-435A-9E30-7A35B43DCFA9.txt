"In this paper, we describe a web-based interactive programming exercise system, aimed in part at addressing the retention crisis in computer science education. The system is based on automatic program-checking software. It is designed to be easy for students and faculty to use, to support a wide variety of programming exercises, and to encourage sharing of exercises among faculty. The system is immediately available to anyone with web access with no arrangements needed. Special features such as roster maintenance can be arranged with a minimum of effort."
