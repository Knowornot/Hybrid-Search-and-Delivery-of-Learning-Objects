"The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) was launched in 1992 by the International Lithosphere Program (ILP) with the support of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), and endorsed as a demonstration program in the framework of the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (UN/IDNDR). The GSHAP project terminated in 1999."  This site has excellent maps for the continents showing seismicity, source zones, and hazards.  A catalog of all data and any relevant reports released are available for each map as well.
