"The Bioengineering Ph.D. is an interdisciplinary degree conferred by Georgia Tech.

    * For the Bioengineering Ph.D. curriculum, students have flexibility in choosing courses to fulfill requirements in areas of biosciences, mathematics, bioengineering, traditional engineering and electives.
    * In the Bioengineering Ph.D., students select their thesis advisor in the fall of their 1st year and then begin their thesis research.
    * Students are not admitted to an M.S. degree program in Bioengineering unless they are deficient in requirements.

The Bioengineering Program is an interdisciplinary graduate program offering advanced courses in bioengineering, engineering specialties, and life sciences combined with training in cutting-edge bioengineering research. Bioengineering research focuses on the development of new or improved physical and mathematical concepts and techniques which may be applied to problems in medicine and biology, including fundamental study of biological phenomena and development of new medical devices."
