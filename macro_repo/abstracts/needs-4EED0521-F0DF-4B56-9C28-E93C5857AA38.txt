The goal of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of a multilevel participatory action model to produce institutional transformation resulting in the full participation of women faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the university. This model focuses on transforming departmental cultures (views, attitudes, norms and shared beliefs), practices (what people say and do), and structures (physical and social arrangements) as well as university policies through active participation of individuals at all levels of the university.
