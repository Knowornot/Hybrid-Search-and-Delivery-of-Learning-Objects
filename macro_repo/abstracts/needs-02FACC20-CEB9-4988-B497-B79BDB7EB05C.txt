The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has been mapping and studying California's natural resources and hazards for more than 100 years. In this time, the State population has grown from less than 1 million to more than 30 million, which has increased demands on resources and exposed more people to natural hazards. Many population centers are in areas of natural hazards. Population growth, combined with development in arid and semiarid regions of the State, has stressed California's water resources. USGS information is available to help people understand and deal with natural hazards and water-supply stresses.
