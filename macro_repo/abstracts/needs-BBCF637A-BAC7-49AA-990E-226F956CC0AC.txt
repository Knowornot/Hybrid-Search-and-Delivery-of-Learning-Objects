Geomatic engineering curriculum and links. ABET-accredited with links to their goals and learning outcomes.
"Geomatics Engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving and maintaining our national spatial infrastructure. Geomatics systems include: real property boundary determination, aerial and digital mapping, land and geographic information systems (LIS/GIS), geodesy and geodetic surveying (GPS), remote sensing, environmental and resource mapping, Geomatics applications programming, project management, route design and construction location. While learning how to use a vast array of Geomatics tools a solid theoretical grounding prepares you for a recession proof Geomatics engineering career.  The curriculum provides a unique blend of practical and theoretical knowledge. Laboratories support most of the classes."
