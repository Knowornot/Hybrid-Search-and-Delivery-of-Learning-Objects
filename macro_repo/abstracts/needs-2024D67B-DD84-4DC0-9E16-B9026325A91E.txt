"The B.S.Ch.E. degree is a professional degree that prepares graduates for employment and graduate study in chemical engineering and related fields, as well as entry into professional programs such as medicine, dentistry, law, and business.

    Chemical engineers apply economics, chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics to the design and operation of processes and to the research and development of new materials, processes, and systems. The many and varied issues associated with going from concept to demonstration to operation of processes and equipment all fall within the province of chemical engineering. Chemical engineers are as comfortable with plant operations, research and development projects, synthesis of alternative fuels, energy conservation and conversion, process design, optimization and control, environmental conservation and pollution prevention, as they are with the exciting fundamental studies associated with biotechnology, nanotechnology, electrochemical technology, and other areas yet to be discovered."
