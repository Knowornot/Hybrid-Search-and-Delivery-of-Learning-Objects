"Using DNA origami, researchers have assembled a nano-sized box with lock and key.

Using nothing but DNA, researchers in Denmark have constructed a tiny box with a lid that can either lock shut or--with the help of a set of DNA keys--hinge open. While other groups have experimented with using DNA origami to build three-dimensional objects, the new box, described in this week's edition of Nature, is distinguished by its solid sides and moving parts.

"It's a rather beautiful molecular structure," says John Reif, a distinguished professor of computer science at Duke University, who was not involved in the research. "It's the first time that a nanostructure like that had a programmable and controllable lid."

For now, the box serves as a proof of principle that DNA origami can be adapted to make elaborate three-dimensional structures, says JÃ¸rgen Kjems, a molecular biologist at the Aarhus University Center for DNA Nanotechnology, who led the research. But in the future, he believes that the nano-sized container could be adapted for a wide range of applications, from drug-delivery vehicle to logic gate."

Image caption: Deoxyribose sugar cubes: Because complementary regions of DNA like to pair up, researchers were able to design a long strand of DNA that, combined with many tiny DNA staples, would automatically assemble itself into a nano-sized box. This technique is known as DNA origami. Here, the boxes were imaged using cryo-electron tomography to confirm their cubelike structures and hollow interior.
