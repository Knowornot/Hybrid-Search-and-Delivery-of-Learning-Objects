"Nanoscale cantilevers -- microscopic, flexible beams resembling a row of diving boards --  are built using semiconductor lithographic techniques. These can be coated with molecules capable of binding specific substrates -- DNA complementary to a specific gene sequence, for example. Such micron-sized devices, comprising many nanometer-sized cantilevers, can detect single molecules of DNA or protein."
