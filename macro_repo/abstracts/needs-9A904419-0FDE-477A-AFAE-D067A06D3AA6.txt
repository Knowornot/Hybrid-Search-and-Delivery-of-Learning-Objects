"The Department of Bioengineering participates in the MD/Ph.D. program, administered by the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). Students who wish to follow this path should complete a combined application through MSTP.

MSTP students start their Ph.D. work with a lab rotation during the summer immediately prior to starting medical school. In September they enter medical school with their class.

During the second summer they do another lab rotation (Ph.D. credit), then proceed to the second year of medical school. At the end of the second year they pass Part 1 of the National Board Exams. That summer they can either do a third lab rotation or enter the graduate program. After completing their Ph.D. coursework, they return to the final 2 years of medical school (clinical rotations)."
