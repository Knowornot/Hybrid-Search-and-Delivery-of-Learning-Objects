The MET program at the California Meritime Academy offers two degree programs:  Facilities Engineering Technology and Marine Engineering Technology.  The focus and requirements of each degree program are unique.  However, the fundamental principles and educational philosophies share common strategies and are based on a four-phase approach of intellectual learning, applied technology, leadership development, and global awareness.

Intellectual learning is achieved in the classroom.  It begins with a foundation in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Computer Science, and progresses into the engineering technology sciences of Solid and Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Power Systems, and Electrical/Controls.  It is rounded out with courses in Humanities, History, Communications, Ethics, and Management.
