This United States Geological Survey (USGS) program addresses  water-quality conditions and how those conditions may vary locally, regionally, and nationally; whether conditions are getting better or worse over time; and how natural features and human activities affect those conditions. The goal is to develop long-term consistent and comparable information on streams, ground water, and aquatic ecosystems to support sound management and policy decisions. The program assesses over 50 river basins and aquifer systems, and helps to inform decision makers about the state of US water resources. Issues addressed include how and why water quality varies across the nation, trace elements, pesticides, nutrients, volatile organic chemicals (VOC's), water protection and management, and human health. This site links the user to articles, studies, maps, data sets, and other sources of information. A glossary defines over 150 water related terms.
