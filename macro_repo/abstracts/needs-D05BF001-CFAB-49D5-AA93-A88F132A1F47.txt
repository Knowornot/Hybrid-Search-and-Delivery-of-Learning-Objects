The University of Washington (UW) envisions a campus in which all science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) departments are thriving, all faculty are properly mentored, and every SEM faculty member is achieving his or her maximum potential. UW believes that cultural changes that are designed to help underrepresented groups invariably help all groups and improve the environment for everyone. The programs proposed here fall into that category. The University is designing the programs with women SEM faculty in mind, but plans to offer the programs for all faculty after they are piloted and improved.

Specific goals for this proposal are to:

    * Increase the number of women faculty in the SEM departments
    * Increase advancement of women faculty in the SEM departments
    * Increase leadership by women faculty in the SEM departments.
