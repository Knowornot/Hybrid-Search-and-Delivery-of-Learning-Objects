Jakarta (also DKI Jakarta), is the capital and largest city of Indonesia. It was formerly known as Sunda Kalapa (397-1527), Jayakarta (1527-1619), Batavia (1619-1942), and Djakarta (1942-1972). Located on the northwest coast of the Java Island, it has an area of 661.52 km² and an official population of 8,389,443 (2000[1]). Jakarta currently is the eleventh largest city, fifth largest metropolitan area and ninth most densely populated city in the world with 44,283 people per sq mile.[3] Its metropolitan area is called Jabodetabek and contains more than 23 million people, and is part of an even larger Jakarta-Bandung megalopolis.

Jakarta is served by the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Since 2004, Jakarta, under the governance of Sutiyoso, has built a new bus system, which is known as "TransJakarta" or "Busway." Jakarta had hoped to establish its newest transportation system, the Jakarta Monorail, in 2007, but the project has been delayed and its completion date will very likely be pushed back. Jakarta also is the location of the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the National Monument.
