This tutorial will provide an introduction and overview of relevant fields, as well as a consideration of how the advances in each will address the challenges raised by the design of molecular manufacturing systems. Those with science, engineering or software backgrounds are invited to participate and begin preparing for careers in molecular nanotechnology. The ability of a variety of computational tools to simulate the energetic, dynamic and electronic properties of atomic systems has also increased considerably.
