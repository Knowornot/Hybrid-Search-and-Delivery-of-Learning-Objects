"Agriculture in the Classroom is a grassroots program coordinated by the United States Department of Agriculture. Its goal is to help students gain a greater awareness of the role of agriculture in the economy and society, so that they may become citizens who support wise agricultural policies.

The program is carried out in each state, according to state needs and interests, by individuals representing farm organizations, agribusiness, education and government.

The USDA supports the state organizations by:

    * helping to develop Agriculture in the Classroom programs
    * acting as a central clearinghouse for materials and information
    * encouraging USDA agencies to assist in the state programs, and
    * coordinating with national organizations to promote the goal of an increased awareness of agriculture among the nation's students."
