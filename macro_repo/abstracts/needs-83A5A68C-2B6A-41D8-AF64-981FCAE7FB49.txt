" With nearly 60 full-time faculty, the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) is able to offer viable graduate programs in essentially every area associated with contemporary IE and OR. Moreover, many of these programs and/or concentrations rank as "world class", an attribute that makes ISyE truly unique among its peer academic programs in the United States. This distinction of being highly regarded in more than one or two specialties makes ISyE attractive to a diverse and substantial array of potential applicants, both in terms of their prior educational background as well as with regard to specific academic tastes and objectives.

Many individuals who are drawn to areas of study supported by ISyE have engineering degrees. These individuals are attracted by the historically strong role played by IE/OR in modeling and analysis within traditional manufacturing and production settings that now extend to systems associated with the contemporary supply chain where challenging problems in logistics, warehousing, transportation, and distribution tend to predominate.

Others are drawn to IE and OR because they find exciting the notion of dealing with fundamental theoretical issues that are necessitated by formidable levels of complexity attendant to many of the basic problems and problem-solving methodologies of the fields. Often, these students come to ISyE from academic programs such as mathematics "
