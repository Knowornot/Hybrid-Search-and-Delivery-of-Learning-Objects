Abstract: This paper describes a new program for female undergraduate computer science students. The program uses recognized strategies for engaging women in computer science. It includes multi-faceted mentoring, community building activities, and a research program with significant educational components. The research component gives women an opportunity to work in research teams under the direction of a female faculty member who serves as role model. While there are other programs that allow students to work with female faculty on their research, this research program was designed to develop our female students. The research team presents its research at an appropriate conference each year. The team members also reach out to other students by participating in recruiting activities and presenting their research to high school students at local career days. Our program is currently in its second year. This paper describes the program and changes that we have made based on what we learned during the first year.
