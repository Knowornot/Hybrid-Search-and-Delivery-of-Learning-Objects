"The objectives of the graduate program in civil engineering are excellence in engineering education, research, and professional service. The program seeks to educate students to assume leadership positions in engineering practice, research, and education. The program also seeks to advance the state of the art and of the practice of civil engineering at both fundamental and applied levels through extensive research programs, and to disseminate this research through professional and scholarly activities. The program encompasses such disciplines of civil engineering as architectural engineering (including construction engineering and project management, construction materials, and structural engineering), environmental and water resources engineering, geotechnical engineering, ocean engineering, and transportation engineering, as well as interdisciplinary areas of study."
