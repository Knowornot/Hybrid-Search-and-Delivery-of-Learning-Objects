        <Value>What are Physics Illuminations? An "Illumination" is a short, html-readable chunk of explanatory/exploratory material that addresses a specific topic, usually from a conceptual point of view. Illuminations may consist of hypertextual narrations and illustrations, text in combination with simulations, guided conceptual problem solutions, drills with immediate feedback, audio-visual sequences, or descriptions of simple experiments that can be done using readily available materials --- basically anything that can be used by students to help them understand the subject (in this case physics). There are two key features of Illuminations. First, they should be active, in that the user is encouraged to respond to what he/she is reading or observing by answering questions, manipulating objects on screen, changing parameters and running them again, etc. Second, they should be confined to a single, narrowly defined topic so that the discussion or explanation is very brief and the number of options or variable parameters is strictly limited. The Illuminations currently at this Web site consist of Java simulations packaged together with explanatory text. The Java code has been released under the open source GNU General Public License. The explanatory text is in the public domain. The site is organized into sections on 1D Kinematics, 2D Kinematics, Dynamics, Work and Energy, and Vectors. Each component has a tutorial, java simulations and a self-paced quiz. A Sun Java Plug-In is needed to run the simulations (download available from site). How can they be used? These Illuminations were designed primarily for student self-study and practice. Many of them keep a running score of the student's work during the session for self-assessment purposes.</Value>
