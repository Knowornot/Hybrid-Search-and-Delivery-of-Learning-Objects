"The goal of the Elevator Challenge is to provide students and hobbyists a chance to practice their programming skills by addressing a real-life problem - how to most efficiently control the elevators or lifts of a building. At the heart of the challenge is an elevator simulator which allows programmers to design, code and then test their implementation in efficiently managing elevators in different real-world scenarios. You also get the chance to test your skills by comparing results with others, including the option to submit results here to compete against other programmers from around the world."
