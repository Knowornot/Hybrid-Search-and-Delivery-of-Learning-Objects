Type:  Partnerships for Adaptation, Implementation, and Dissemination.
Year Awarded: 2008. 

Description: The National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) will adapt, implement and disseminate successful models and best practices employed by ADVANCE grant recipients and others to assist women scientists to advance in academia. This project will focus adaptation in two areas: 1) translating efforts targeted at current women faculty to women training to become faculty, i.e., postdocs; and 2) translating professional development efforts targeted at the general postdoctoral population to address the unique needs of women during the postdoctoral training period. The primary purpose of these translational efforts will be to assist women in making a successful transition from the postdoctoral training period to the ranks of tenure track faculty. Major project components include: - Conducting a review of all institutional efforts made by ADVANCE recipients to address these issues, using a survey and targeted follow-up; - Convening a focus group of ADVANCE postdoctoral fellows to determine whether the fellowship helped them to obtain a faculty position; - Organizing a National Summit on Gender and the Postdoctorate; - Providing on-going technical assistance to summit participants and others who wish to implement programs for postdocs at their institutions; - Preparing and disseminating a compendium report of models and recommended practices for helping women make a successful transition from postdoc to faculty; ..."
