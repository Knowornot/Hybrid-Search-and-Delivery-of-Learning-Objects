The MU-ADVANCE mission is to "To increase recruitment and retention of female STEM faculty at Marshall through faculty development initiatives, enhanced recruitment efforts, and improved institutional climate.

The goal is to empower a strong core of administrators and female science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty to initiate and maintain institutional climate change, and to improve the recruitment and success of female faculty.

The Program provides a unique setting in which to test an important model of faculty-administrator partnerships for implementing change at a primarily undergraduate institution and within the West Virginia (WV) higher education system. The MU-ADVANCE Program will impact STEM faculty in four of Marshall's colleges through an integrated approach comprised of three initiatives: 1) Recruitment and Networking; 2) Faculty Development; and 3) State and Institutional Policy."
